    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, but their potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a classic challenge in combinatorial optimization that requires efficient job allocation to machines to minimize makespan. To this end, we introduce Starjob, the first supervised dataset for JSSP, comprising 130k instances specifically designed for training LLMs. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune the LLaMA 8B 4-bit quantized model with the LoRA method to develop an end-to-end scheduling approach. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based method not only surpasses traditional Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) but also achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art neural approaches like L2D, with an average improvement of 15.36% on DMU and 7.85% on Taillard benchmarks. These results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs in tackling combinatorial optimization problems, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we propose a metric called Number of Thoughts (NofT) to determine the difficulty of tasks pre-prompting and support Large Language Models (LLMs) in production contexts. By setting thresholds based on the number of thoughts, this metric can discern the difficulty of prompts and support more effective prompt routing. A 2% decrease in latency is achieved when routing prompts from the MathInstruct dataset through quantized, distilled versions of Deepseek with 1.7 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters. Moreover, this metric can be used to detect adversarial prompts used in prompt injection attacks with high efficacy. The Number of Thoughts can inform a classifier that achieves 95% accuracy in adversarial prompt detection.

    <div class="abstract">Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing demand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

    <div class="abstract">While standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on chunks, GraphRAG structures knowledge as graphs to leverage the relations among entities. However, previous GraphRAG methods are limited by binary relations: one edge in the graph only connects two entities, which cannot well model the n-ary relations among more than two entities that widely exist in reality. To address this limitation, we propose HyperGraphRAG, a novel hypergraph-based RAG method that represents n-ary relational facts via hyperedges, modeling the complicated n-ary relations in the real world. To retrieve and generate over hypergraphs, we introduce a complete pipeline with a hypergraph construction method, a hypergraph retrieval strategy, and a hypergraph-guided generation mechanism. Experiments across medicine, agriculture, computer science, and law demonstrate that HyperGraphRAG outperforms standard RAG and GraphRAG in accuracy and generation quality.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is known as a promising approach to enhancing their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve it. Nevertheless, our investigation reveals that (1) training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from more synthetic data due to potential data diversity issues, resulting in poor performance in complex scenarios. Moreover, we find that (2) this challenge primarily manifests as minor discrepancies between the model's output and the ground truth response (termed as deficiency), such as errors in parameter values that require complex reasoning from the context to resolve. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate these challenges. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively identifying deficiency-related data, constructing fine-grained preference pairs to pinpoint deficiencies, and then applying preference optimization to optimize these deficiencies. Our experiments show that models trained using our method achieve about 12\% better performance than baseline models, outperforming larger open-source and closed-source models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of LLM agents: autonomous systems capable of achieving under-specified goals and adapting post-deployment, often without explicit code or model changes. Evaluating these agents is critical to ensuring their performance and safety, especially given their dynamic, probabilistic, and evolving nature. However, traditional approaches such as predefined test cases and standard redevelopment pipelines struggle to address the unique challenges of LLM agent evaluation. These challenges include capturing open-ended behaviors, handling emergent outcomes, and enabling continuous adaptation over the agent's lifecycle. To address these issues, we propose an evaluation-driven development approach, inspired by test-driven and behavior-driven development but reimagined for the unique characteristics of LLM agents. Through a multivocal literature review (MLR), we synthesize the limitations of existing LLM evaluation methods and introduce a novel process model and reference architecture tailored for evaluation-driven development of LLM agents. Our approach integrates online (runtime) and offline (redevelopment) evaluations, enabling adaptive runtime adjustments and systematic iterative refinement of pipelines, artifacts, system architecture, and LLMs themselves. By continuously incorporating evaluation results, including fine-grained feedback from human and AI evaluators, into each stage of development and operation, this framework ensures that LLM agents remain aligned with evolving goals, user needs, and governance standards.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited multi-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing multi-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the assistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15% on MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board," "understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks. To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human. State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring non-trivial prompt engineering).   In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic research investigations in future.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL, driven by large language models, are democratizing data access. Despite these advancements, enterprise deployments remain challenging due to the need to capture business-specific knowledge, handle complex queries, and meet expectations of continuous improvements. To address these issues, we designed and implemented GenEdit: our Text-to-SQL generation system that improves with user feedback. GenEdit builds and maintains a company-specific knowledge set, employs a pipeline of operators decomposing SQL generation, and uses feedback to update its knowledge set to improve future SQL generations.   We describe GenEdit's architecture made of two core modules: (i) decomposed SQL generation; and (ii) knowledge set edits based on user feedback. For generation, GenEdit leverages compounding operators to improve knowledge retrieval and to create a plan as chain-of-thought steps that guides generation. GenEdit first retrieves relevant examples in an initial retrieval stage where original SQL queries are decomposed into sub-statements, clauses or sub-queries. It then also retrieves instructions and schema elements. Using the retrieved contextual information, GenEdit then generates step-by-step plan in natural language on how to produce the query. Finally, GenEdit uses the plan to generate SQL, minimizing the need for model reasoning, which enhances complex SQL generation. If necessary, GenEdit regenerates the query based on syntactic and semantic errors. The knowledge set edits are recommended through an interactive copilot, allowing users to iterate on their feedback and to regenerate SQL queries as needed. Each generation uses staged edits which update the generation prompt. Once the feedback is submitted, it gets merged after passing regression testing and obtaining an approval, improving future generations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The success of large language models has garnered widespread attention for model merging techniques, especially training-free methods which combine model capabilities within the parameter space. However, two challenges remain: (1) uniform treatment of all parameters leads to performance degradation; (2) search-based algorithms are often inefficient. In this paper, we present an innovative framework termed Reinforced Model Merging (RMM), which encompasses an environment and agent tailored for merging tasks. These components interact to execute layer-wise merging actions, aiming to search the optimal merging architecture. Notably, RMM operates without any gradient computations on the original models, rendering it feasible for edge devices. Furthermore, by utilizing data subsets during the evaluation process, we addressed the bottleneck in the reward feedback phase, thereby accelerating RMM by up to 100 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various vision and NLP datasets and effectively overcomes the limitations of the existing baseline methods.

    <div class="abstract">Advancements in retrieving accessible information have evolved faster in the last few years compared to the decades since the internet's creation. Search engines, like Google, have been the number one way to find relevant data. They have always relied on the user's abilities to find the best information in its billions of links and sources at everybody's fingertips. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has completely transformed the field of information retrieval. The LLMs excel not only at retrieving relevant knowledge but also at summarizing it effectively, making information more accessible and consumable for users. On top of it, the rise of AI Agents has introduced another aspect to information retrieval i.e. dynamic information retrieval which enables the integration of real-time data such as weather forecasts, and financial data with the knowledge base to curate context-aware knowledge. However, despite these advancements the agents remain susceptible to issues of bias and fairness, challenges deeply rooted within the knowledge base and training of LLMs. This study introduces a novel approach to bias-aware knowledge retrieval by leveraging agentic framework and the innovative use of bias detectors as tools to identify and highlight inherent biases in the retrieved content. By empowering users with transparency and awareness, this approach aims to foster more equitable information systems and promote the development of responsible AI.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The surge in generative AI workloads has created a need for scalable inference systems that can flexibly harness both GPUs and specialized accelerators while containing operational costs. This paper proposes a hardware-agnostic control loop that adaptively allocates requests across heterogeneous accelerators based on real-time cost and capacity signals. The approach sustains low latency and high throughput by dynamically shifting between cost-optimized and capacity-optimized modes, ensuring the most efficient use of expensive compute resources under fluctuating availability. Evaluated using the Stable Diffusion model, the framework consistently meets latency targets, automatically redirects traffic during capacity shortfalls, and capitalizes on lower-cost accelerators when possible. These results highlight how a feedback-driven deployment strategy, spanning the entire software and hardware stack, can help organizations efficiently scale generative AI workloads while maintaining resilience in the face of limited accelerator capacity.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in predicting mental health outcomes from online text, yet traditional classification methods often lack interpretability and robustness. This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.</div>

    <h3>R2-KG: General-Purpose Dual-Agent Framework for Reliable Reasoning on   Knowledge Graphs</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without additional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing frameworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They also rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across multiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while reducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning. It reduces reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference. The code is available at https://github.com/ekrxjwh2009/R2-KG/.</div>
