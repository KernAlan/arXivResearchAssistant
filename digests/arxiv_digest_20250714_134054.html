    <div class="abstract">Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent (https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent). The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting. The code is available at: https://github.com/dcy0577/Text2BIM</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy) drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM, fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations, receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise, actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets (Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and mitigating energy inefficiencies.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on multi-turn reasoning datasets requires N (number of turns) separate forward passes per conversation due to reasoning token visibility constraints, as reasoning tokens for a turn are discarded in subsequent turns. We propose duplicating response tokens along with a custom attention mask to enable single-pass processing of entire conversations. We prove our method produces identical losses to the N-pass approach while reducing time complexity from $O\bigl(N^{3}\bigl)$ to $O\bigl(N^{2}\bigl)$ and maintaining the same memory complexity for a transformer based model. Our approach achieves significant training speedup while preserving accuracy. Our implementation is available online (https://github.com/devrev/One-Pass-to-Reason).</div>

    <div class="abstract">Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general world knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and products. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search systems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product retrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2) product term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system from scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While the second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant difference in word distribution between queries and products means that product-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries, leading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency.   To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism. By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable knowledge fusion performance of KGA.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving linear efficiency.   Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks (vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer, Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.   By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy, WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI development.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks, in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal. While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages. Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.</div>

    <h3>Upgrade or Switch: Do We Need a Next-Gen Trusted Architecture for the   Internet of AI Agents?</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built index architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2) Switch options, (3) Hybrid index/registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized indexes for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In cognition theory, human thinking is governed by two systems: the fast and intuitive System 1 and the slower but more deliberative System 2. Analogously, Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate in two reasoning modes: outputting only the solutions (\emph{fast mode}) or both the reasoning chain and the final solution (\emph{slow mode}). We present \dualformer, a single Transformer model that seamlessly integrates both the fast and slow reasoning modes by training on randomized reasoning traces, where different parts of the traces are strategically dropped during training. At inference time, \dualformer can be easily configured to execute in either fast or slow mode, or automatically decide which mode to engage (\emph{auto mode}). It outperforms baselines in both performance and computational efficiency across all three modes: (1) in slow mode, \dualformer achieves $97.6\%$ optimal rate on unseen $30 \times 30$ maze tasks, surpassing the \searchformer baseline ($93.3\%$) trained on data with complete reasoning traces, with $45.5\%$ fewer reasoning steps; (2) in fast mode, \dualformer achieves $80\%$ optimal rate, significantly outperforming the Solution-Only model trained on solution-only data, which has an optimal rate of only $30\%$; (3) in auto mode, \dualformer achieves $96.6\%$ optimal rate with $59.9\%$ fewer steps than \searchformer. Moreover, \dualformer produces more diverse reasoning traces than \searchformer{}. For math reasoning problems, our techniques have also achieved improved performance with LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating its generalization beyond task-specific models. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/dualformer.</div>
