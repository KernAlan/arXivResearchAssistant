    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B) are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free) and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths? We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the problem.   This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model, which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment constraints.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Electronic Discovery (eDiscovery) requires identifying relevant documents from vast collections for legal production requests. While artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have improved document review efficiency, current methods still struggle with legal entities, citations, and complex legal artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce DISCOvery Graph (DISCOG), an emerging system that integrates knowledge graphs for enhanced document ranking and classification, augmented by LLM-driven reasoning. DISCOG outperforms strong baselines in F1-score, precision, and recall across both balanced and imbalanced datasets. In real-world deployments, it has reduced litigation-related document review costs by approximately 98\%, demonstrating significant business impact.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed, rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models, ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7 percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of 0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6 percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093), suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how they arrive at those decisions</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard performance.

    <div class="abstract">Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the \textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain} automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to handle abstentions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions: interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable, enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration, we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it, we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate misalignment more generally.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To facilitate future work, we will release code.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings, characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories. Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods struggle.</div>

To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs without diminishing overall performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second, for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence improving robustness.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances. Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored support for family caregivers.</div>

    <h3>Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with SlowFast Sampling: The   Three Golden Principles</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.</div>

    <h3>Intra-Trajectory Consistency for Reward Modeling</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

    <h3>Improving Large Language Models with Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI. However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e., artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community.
