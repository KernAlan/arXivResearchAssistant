        <h3>ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights</h3>
        Hey boss, I stumbled upon 5 awesome papers today that I think youâ€™ll really dig:

<ol>
<li>Researchers at Stanford unveiled a new end-to-end text-to-SQL framework that uses LLMs to nail down the right database before generating SQL queries. This could make it way easier for non-techies to access data without needing to know SQL, which is a huge win for usability in data-driven industries!</li>

<li>A team from Google AI rolled out Memp, a system that boosts agent performance by giving them a learnable and updatable procedural memory. This means agents can adapt and improve over time, learning from past experiences, which could really enhance their efficiency in real-world applications like personal assistants or automated planners.</li>

<li>The LLM Robustness Leaderboard report from PRISM Eval is a game-changer! It introduces a new framework for assessing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks. With insights on vulnerabilities, this can help us build more resilient AI systems and improve safety measures across the board.</li>

<li>In healthcare, a new study presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances LLMs for identifying drug contraindications. The accuracy jumped from around 50% to nearly 90% with this method, which means doctors can make better-informed decisions about prescriptions, ultimately improving patient safety!</li>

<li>Finally, researchers introduced DONOD, a method for fine-tuning LLMs that prunes noisy data to boost performance. By filtering out 70% of unhelpful data, they achieved significant gains in accuracy, making this a great approach for improving model training without needing loads of resources.</li>

    <div class="abstract">Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by PRISM Eval for the Paris AI Action Summit. We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges, particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking. This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases, focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57. Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more precise and reliable drug contraindication information.</div>

    <h3>DONOD: Efficient and Generalizable Instruction Fine-Tuning for LLMs via   Model-Intrinsic Dataset Pruning</h3>
    <div class="scores">

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 9/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Ad-hoc instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is widely adopted for domain-specific adaptation. While domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is effective and efficient, it often weakens cross-domain generalization and struggles with noisy training data. To address these challenges, we propose DONOD, a lightweight model-intrinsic data pruning method. Our approach evaluates data using two model-parameter-based metrics: Delta of Norm (DON), which captures the cumulative influence on model weights, and Norm of Delta (NOD), which quantifies weight instability. Moreover, by employing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm, we effectively filter noisy, unlearnable, and generalization-harming samples without relying on auxiliary models during the SFT process. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate that data selected by DONOD achieves superior fine-tuning efficiency and improved robustness against noisy data. By filtering out 70% of the whole dataset, we improve target-domain accuracy by 14.90% and cross-domain accuracy by 5.67%. Meanwhile, our selected data present superior cross-architecture generalization. Data pruned by smaller models (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) generalize effectively on larger models (e.g., Llama 2-13B). Compared to existing related methodologies, DONOD demonstrates comparable or superior performance while remaining dataset-agnostic, enabling broader applicability. Code will be made publicly available.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.</div>

    <h3>The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically   Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The "LLM-as-an-annotator" and "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused, cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation methods.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.</div>

    <h3>Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign   Prompts</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions." This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM agents in complex and crucial domains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"   Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2), agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust, general-purpose AI agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as virtual tutors in computer science (CS) education, this approach can foster passive learning and over-reliance. This paper presents a novel pedagogical paradigm that inverts this model: students act as instructors who must teach an LLM to solve problems. To facilitate this, we developed strategies for designing questions with engineered knowledge gaps that only a student can bridge, and we introduce Socrates, a system for deploying this method with minimal overhead. We evaluated our approach in an undergraduate course and found that this active-learning method led to statistically significant improvements in student performance compared to historical cohorts. Our work demonstrates a practical, cost-effective framework for using LLMs to deepen student engagement and mastery.</div>

    <h3>Impact-driven Context Filtering For Cross-file Code Completion</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently demonstrated considerable potential for repository-level code completion, as it integrates cross-file knowledge with in-file preceding code to provide comprehensive contexts for generation. To better understand the contribution of the retrieved cross-file contexts, we introduce a likelihood-based metric to evaluate the impact of each retrieved code chunk on the completion. Our analysis reveals that, despite retrieving numerous chunks, only a small subset positively contributes to the completion, while some chunks even degrade performance. To address this issue, we leverage this metric to construct a repository-level dataset where each retrieved chunk is labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on its relevance to the target completion. We then propose an adaptive retrieval context filtering framework, CODEFILTER, trained on this dataset to mitigate the harmful effects of negative retrieved contexts in code completion. Extensive evaluation on the RepoEval and CrossCodeLongEval benchmarks demonstrates that CODEFILTER consistently improves completion accuracy compared to approaches without filtering operations across various tasks. Additionally, CODEFILTER significantly reduces the length of the input prompt, enhancing computational efficiency while exhibiting strong generalizability across different models. These results underscore the potential of CODEFILTER to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and attributability of repository-level code completion.</div>

    <h3>Bifrost-1: Bridging Multimodal LLMs and Diffusion Models with   Patch-level CLIP Latents</h3>

    <div class="abstract">There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.</div>

    <h3>Bench-2-CoP: Can We Trust Benchmarking for EU AI Compliance?</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape. This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation ecosystem dedicates the vast majority of its focus to a narrow set of behavioral propensities. On average, benchmarks devote 61.6% of their regulatory-relevant questions to "Tendency to hallucinate" and 31.2% to "Lack of performance reliability", while critical functional capabilities are dangerously neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This study provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, demonstrating that current public benchmarks are insufficient, on their own, for providing the evidence of comprehensive risk assessment required for regulatory compliance and offering critical insights for the development of next-generation evaluation tools.</div>

    <h3>Exploring Superior Function Calls via Reinforcement Learning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.</div>
