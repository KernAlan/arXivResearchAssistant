    <div class="abstract">Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated exceptional performance in UI2Code tasks, significantly enhancing website development efficiency. However, these tasks incur substantially higher computational overhead than traditional code generation due to the large number of input image tokens and extensive output code tokens required. Our comprehensive study identifies significant redundancies in both image and code tokens that exacerbate computational complexity and hinder focus on key UI elements, resulting in excessively lengthy and often invalid HTML files. We propose EfficientUICoder, a compression framework for efficient UI code generation with three key components. First, Element and Layout-aware Token Compression preserves essential UI information by detecting element regions and constructing UI element trees. Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores to discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating high-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token Suppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS structure frequencies and applying exponential penalties. Extensive experiments show EfficientUICoderachieves a 55%-60% compression ratio without compromising webpage quality and delivers superior efficiency improvements: reducing computational cost by 44.9%, generated tokens by 41.4%, prefill time by 46.6%, and inference time by 48.8% on 34B-level MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/WebPAI/EfficientUICoder.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original, filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced solutions across various domains, from political science to software development. However, these models are constrained by their training data, which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date. Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning -- whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data, enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements, AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over 10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1) search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4) iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact and high-performing.

    <div class="abstract">The petroleum industry faces unprecedented challenges in reservoir management, requiring rapid integration of complex multimodal datasets for real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering, entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.</div>

    <h3>Beyond Autoregression: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Large Language   Models for Code Generation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">LLMs have become the mainstream approaches to code generation. Existing LLMs mainly employ autoregressive generation, i.e. generating code token-by-token from left to right. However, the underlying autoregressive generation has two limitations in code generation. First, autoregressive LLMs only generate a token at each step, showing low efficiency in practice. Second, programming is a non-sequential process involving back-and-forth editing, while autoregressive LLMs only employ the left-to-right generation order. These two intrinsic limitations hinder the further development of LLMs in code generation. Recently, diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative. Diffusion LLMs address the above limitations with two advances, including multi-token prediction (i.e. generating multiple tokens at each step) and flexible generation order (i.e. flexibly determining which positions to generate tokens). However, there is no systematic study exploring diffusion LLMs in code generation. To bridge the knowledge gap, we present the first empirical study of diffusion LLMs for code generation. Our study involves 9 representative diffusion LLMs and conduct experiments on 4 widely used benchmarks. Based on the results, we summarize the following findings. (1) Existing diffusion LLMs are competitive with autoregressive LLMs with similar sizes. (2) Diffusion LLMs have a stronger length extrapolation ability than autoregressive LLMs and perform better in long code understanding. (3) We explore factors impacting the effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion LLMs, and provide practical guidance. (4) We discuss several promising further directions to improve diffusion LLMs on code generation. We open-source all source code, data, and results to facilitate the following research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/dllm4code.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings. Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely, and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged. Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.   METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025), we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models (LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation, modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.   RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases, outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached 98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text, physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.   CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</div>

EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and (iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot, the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without disrupting general performance.   We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.   When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its components and their interplay.</div>

    <h3>Reasoned Safety Alignment: Ensuring Jailbreak Defense via   Answer-Then-Check</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check, which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks. Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm). Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has lead to the development of agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction with external tools. In enterprise contexts, the effective use of such tools that are often enabled by application programming interfaces (APIs), is hindered by poor documentation, complex input or output schema, and large number of operations. These challenges make tool selection difficult and reduce the accuracy of payload formation by up to 25%. We propose ACE, an automated tool creation and enrichment framework that transforms enterprise APIs into LLM-compatible tools. ACE, (i) generates enriched tool specifications with parameter descriptions and examples to improve selection and invocation accuracy, and (ii) incorporates a dynamic shortlisting mechanism that filters relevant tools at runtime, reducing prompt complexity while maintaining scalability. We validate our framework on both proprietary and open-source APIs and demonstrate its integration with agentic frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, ACE is the first end-to-end framework that automates the creation, enrichment, and dynamic selection of enterprise API tools for LLM agents.</div>

    <h3>A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large   Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.</div>
