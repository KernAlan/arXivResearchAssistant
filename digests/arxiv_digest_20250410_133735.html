    <div class="abstract">This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR) technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free, context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction. Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing.

    <div class="abstract">Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Effective and rapid evaluation of pavement surface condition is critical for prioritizing maintenance, ensuring transportation safety, and minimizing vehicle wear and tear. While conventional manual inspections suffer from subjectivity, existing machine learning-based methods are constrained by their reliance on large and high-quality labeled datasets, which require significant resources and limit adaptability across varied road conditions. The revolutionary advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant potential for overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose an innovative automated zero-shot learning approach that leverages the image recognition and natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to assess road conditions effectively. Multiple LLM-based assessment models were developed, employing prompt engineering strategies aligned with the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) standards. These models' accuracy and reliability were evaluated against official PSCI results, with an optimized model ultimately selected. Extensive tests benchmarked the optimized model against evaluations from various levels experts using Google Street View road images. The results reveal that the LLM-based approach can effectively assess road conditions, with the optimized model -employing comprehensive and structured prompt engineering strategies -outperforming simpler configurations by achieving high accuracy and consistency, even surpassing expert evaluations. Moreover, successfully applying the optimized model to Google Street View images demonstrates its potential for future city-scale deployments. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating road damage evaluations and underscore the pivotal role of detailed prompt engineering in achieving reliable assessments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Business processes are fundamental to organizational operations, yet their optimization remains challenging due to the timeconsuming nature of manual process analysis. Our paper harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate value-added analysis, a qualitative process analysis technique that aims to identify steps in the process that do not deliver value. To date, this technique is predominantly manual, time-consuming, and subjective. Our method offers a more principled approach which operates in two phases: first, decomposing high-level activities into detailed steps to enable granular analysis, and second, performing a value-added analysis to classify each step according to Lean principles. This approach enables systematic identification of waste while maintaining the semantic understanding necessary for qualitative analysis. We develop our approach using 50 business process models, for which we collect and publish manual ground-truth labels. Our evaluation, comparing zero-shot baselines with more structured prompts reveals (a) a consistent benefit of structured prompting and (b) promising performance for both tasks. We discuss the potential for LLMs to augment human expertise in qualitative process analysis while reducing the time and subjectivity inherent in manual approaches.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown substantial capacity for generating fluent, contextually appropriate responses. However, they can produce hallucinated outputs, especially when a user query includes one or more false premises-claims that contradict established facts. Such premises can mislead LLMs into offering fabricated or misleading details. Existing approaches include pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference-time techniques that often rely on access to logits or address hallucinations after they occur. These methods tend to be computationally expensive, require extensive training data, or lack proactive mechanisms to prevent hallucination before generation, limiting their efficiency in real-time applications. We propose a retrieval-based framework that identifies and addresses false premises before generation. Our method first transforms a user's query into a logical representation, then applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to assess the validity of each premise using factual sources. Finally, we incorporate the verification results into the LLM's prompt to maintain factual consistency in the final output. Experiments show that this approach effectively reduces hallucinations, improves factual accuracy, and does not require access to model logits or large-scale fine-tuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In recent years, large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a variety of tasks. However, their potential in the domain of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) remains largely underexplored. Moreover, compared to English data, the methods for Chinese AES is not well developed. In this paper, we propose Rank-Then-Score (RTS), a fine-tuning framework based on large language models to enhance their essay scoring capabilities. Specifically, we fine-tune the ranking model (Ranker) with feature-enriched data, and then feed the output of the ranking model, in the form of a candidate score set, with the essay content into the scoring model (Scorer) to produce the final score. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, HSK and ASAP, demonstrate that RTS consistently outperforms the direct prompting (Vanilla) method in terms of average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, and achieves the best performance on Chinese essay scoring using the HSK dataset.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in large-scale generative language models have shown that reasoning capabilities can significantly improve model performance across a variety of tasks. However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced smart education in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) era. A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: (1) Customized Generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states, and (2) Intelligent Optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multi-agent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. Additionally, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based five-dimensional evaluation module encompassing clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Zc0812/Edu_Planner</div>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 8/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) is prone to catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks significantly degrades performance on previously learned ones. Existing methods typically rely on low-rank, parameter-efficient updates that limit the model's expressivity and introduce additional parameters per task, leading to scalability issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel continual full fine-tuning approach leveraging adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). Our method dynamically identifies task-specific low-rank parameter subspaces and constrains updates to be orthogonal to critical directions associated with prior tasks, thus effectively minimizing interference without additional parameter overhead or storing previous task gradients. We evaluate our approach extensively on standard continual learning benchmarks using both encoder-decoder (T5-Large) and decoder-only (LLaMA-2 7B) models, spanning diverse tasks including classification, generation, and reasoning. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, up to 7% higher average accuracy than recent baselines like O-LoRA, and notably maintains the model's general linguistic capabilities, instruction-following accuracy, and safety throughout the continual learning process by reducing forgetting to near-negligible levels. Our adaptive SVD framework effectively balances model plasticity and knowledge retention, providing a practical, theoretically grounded, and computationally scalable solution for continual learning scenarios in large language models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Assistance games are a promising alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training AI assistants. Assistance games resolve key drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential, assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards, enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex environments.

    <div class="abstract">This paper introduces a comprehensive system for detecting hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs in enterprise settings. We present a novel taxonomy of LLM responses specific to hallucination in enterprise applications, categorizing them into context-based, common knowledge, enterprise-specific, and innocuous statements. Our hallucination detection model HDM-2 validates LLM responses with respect to both context and generally known facts (common knowledge). It provides both hallucination scores and word-level annotations, enabling precise identification of problematic content. To evaluate it on context-based and common-knowledge hallucinations, we introduce a new dataset HDMBench. Experimental results demonstrate that HDM-2 out-performs existing approaches across RagTruth, TruthfulQA, and HDMBench datasets. This work addresses the specific challenges of enterprise deployment, including computational efficiency, domain specialization, and fine-grained error identification. Our evaluation dataset, model weights, and inference code are publicly available.</div>

    <h3>Bridging the Gap Between Preference Alignment and Machine Unlearning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Despite advances in Preference Alignment (PA) for Large Language Models (LLMs), mainstream methods like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) face notable challenges. These approaches require high-quality datasets of positive preference examples, which are costly to obtain and computationally intensive due to training instability, limiting their use in low-resource scenarios. LLM unlearning technique presents a promising alternative, by directly removing the influence of negative examples. However, current research has primarily focused on empirical validation, lacking systematic quantitative analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework to explore the relationship between PA and LLM unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a bi-level optimization-based method to quantify the impact of unlearning specific negative examples on PA performance. Our analysis reveals that not all negative examples contribute equally to alignment improvement when unlearned, and the effect varies significantly across examples. Building on this insight, we pose a crucial question: how can we optimally select and weight negative examples for unlearning to maximize PA performance? To answer this, we propose a framework called Unlearning to Align (U2A), which leverages bi-level optimization to efficiently select and unlearn examples for optimal PA performance. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, with results confirming its effectiveness.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in a wide range of natural language applications. However, they often struggle to recognize low-resource languages, in particular African languages, which are not well represented in large training corpora. In this paper, we consider how to adapt LLMs to low-resource African languages. We find that combining curated data from African languages with high-quality English educational texts results in a training mix that substantially improves the model's performance on these languages. On the challenging IrokoBench dataset, our models consistently achieve the best performance amongst similarly sized baselines, particularly on knowledge-intensive multiple-choice questions (AfriMMLU). Additionally, on the cross-lingual question answering benchmark AfriQA, our models outperform the base model by over 10%. To better understand the role of English data during training, we translate a subset of 200M tokens into Swahili language and perform an analysis which reveals that the content of these data is primarily responsible for the strong performance. We release our models and data to encourage future research on African languages.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The indistinguishability of AI-generated content from human text raises challenges in transparency and accountability. While several methods exist to watermark models behind APIs, embedding watermark strategies directly into model weights that are later reflected in the outputs of the model is challenging. In this study we propose a strategy to finetune a pair of low-rank adapters of a model, one serving as the text-generating model, and the other as the detector, so that a subtle watermark is embedded into the text generated by the first model and simultaneously optimized for detectability by the second. In this way, the watermarking strategy is fully learned end-to-end. This process imposes an optimization challenge, as balancing watermark robustness, naturalness, and task performance requires trade-offs. We discuss strategies on how to optimize this min-max objective and present results showing the effect of this modification to instruction finetuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics, mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped with the ability to interact with the software through its Application Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex problems in the real world.

    <div class="abstract">Software requirements expressed in natural language (NL) frequently suffer from verbosity, ambiguity, and inconsistency. This creates a range of challenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and assessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to accomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that automates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system, (2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software quality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system that is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of architectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the architectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the current requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world examples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural choices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a particular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the identification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative architectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed therein.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present QGen Studio: an adaptive question-answer generation, training, and evaluation platform. QGen Studio enables users to leverage large language models (LLMs) to create custom question-answer datasets and fine-tune models on this synthetic data. It features a dataset viewer and model explorer to streamline this process. The dataset viewer provides key metrics and visualizes the context from which the QA pairs are generated, offering insights into data quality. The model explorer supports model comparison, allowing users to contrast the performance of their trained LLMs against other models, supporting performance benchmarking and refinement. QGen Studio delivers an interactive, end-to-end solution for generating QA datasets and training scalable, domain-adaptable models. The studio will be open-sourced soon, allowing users to deploy it locally.</div>

    <h3>Confidence Regularized Masked Language Modeling using Text Length</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Masked language modeling is a widely used method for learning language representations, where the model predicts a randomly masked word in each input. However, this approach typically considers only a single correct answer during training, ignoring the variety of plausible alternatives that humans might choose. This issue becomes more pronounced when the input text is short, as the possible word distribution tends to have higher entropy, potentially causing the model to become overconfident in its predictions. To mitigate this, we propose a novel confidence regularizer that adaptively adjusts the regularization strength based on the input length. Experiments on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks show that our method improves both accuracy and expected calibration error</div>

    <h3>Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF</h3>

    <div class="abstract">A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</div>

    <h3>Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of using large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by employing a fine-tuned version of Code Llama. Through parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA, we adapt the LLM to generate accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on exhaustive trials, the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our approach highlights that LLM-based optimization not only matches state-of-the-art methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators but also accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative to conventional optimization techniques, particularly for rapid experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to generate hyperparameters in a single inference step makes this method particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile applications, where computational efficiency is paramount. The results confirm that LLMs, beyond their efficiency, offer substantial time savings and comparable stability, underscoring their value in advancing machine learning workflows. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</div>
