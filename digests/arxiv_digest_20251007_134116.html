    <div class="abstract">With the rapid development of language models, the number of small language models (SLMs) has grown significantly. Although they do not achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, they are more efficient and often excel at specific tasks. This raises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a system where each contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any individual model? Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted frontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To address this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs. First, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively coordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization strategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary SLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our approach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods, our approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0% on GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and GSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical analyses to substantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we demonstrate that SLMs can be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and efficient systems through the proposed approach.</div>

    <h3>Test-Time Scaling in Diffusion LLMs via Hidden Semi-Autoregressive   Experts</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model extreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this information at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice, collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to 3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%. Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a critical role in determining performance during inference.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present a cross-market algorithmic trading system that balances execution quality with rigorous compliance enforcement. The architecture comprises a high-level planner, a reinforcement learning execution agent, and an independent compliance agent. We formulate trade execution as a constrained Markov decision process with hard constraints on participation limits, price bands, and self-trading avoidance. The execution agent is trained with proximal policy optimization, while a runtime action-shield projects any unsafe action into a feasible set. To support auditability without exposing proprietary signals, we add a zero-knowledge compliance audit layer that produces cryptographic proofs that all actions satisfied the constraints. We evaluate in a multi-venue, ABIDES-based simulator and compare against standard baselines (e.g., TWAP, VWAP). The learned policy reduces implementation shortfall and variance while exhibiting no observed constraint violations across stress scenarios including elevated latency, partial fills, compliance module toggling, and varying constraint limits. We report effects at the 95% confidence level using paired t-tests and examine tail risk via CVaR. We situate the work at the intersection of optimal execution, safe reinforcement learning, regulatory technology, and verifiable AI, and discuss ethical considerations, limitations (e.g., modeling assumptions and computational overhead), and paths to real-world deployment.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools, such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9% across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.</div>

    <h3>The Geometry of Truth: Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics for Hallucination   Detection in Large Language Models</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference, while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation, while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

    <h3>Alignment Tipping Process: How Self-Evolution Pushes LLM Agents Off the   Rails</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/ATP.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Computer-use agents (CUAs) powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to automating computer tasks, yet they struggle with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUIs, designed for humans, force LLMs to decompose high-level goals into lengthy, error-prone sequences of fine-grained actions, resulting in low success rates and an excessive number of LLM calls.   We propose Goal-Oriented Interface (GOI), a novel abstraction that transforms existing GUIs into three declarative primitives: access, state, and observation, which are better suited for LLMs. Our key idea is policy-mechanism separation: LLMs focus on high-level semantic planning (policy) while GOI handles low-level navigation and interaction (mechanism). GOI does not require modifying the application source code or relying on application programming interfaces (APIs).   We evaluate GOI with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) on Windows. Compared to a leading GUI-based agent baseline, GOI improves task success rates by 67% and reduces interaction steps by 43.5%. Notably, GOI completes over 61% of successful tasks with a single LLM call.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise systems exposes vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks, strategic deception, and biased outputs, threatening security, trust, and fairness. Extending our adversarial activation patching framework (arXiv:2507.09406), which induced deception in toy networks at a 23.9% rate, we introduce the Unified Threat Detection and Mitigation Framework (UTDMF), a scalable, real-time pipeline for enterprise-grade models like Llama-3.1 (405B), GPT-4o, and Claude-3.5. Through 700+ experiments per model, UTDMF achieves: (1) 92% detection accuracy for prompt injection (e.g., jailbreaking); (2) 65% reduction in deceptive outputs via enhanced patching; and (3) 78% improvement in fairness metrics (e.g., demographic bias). Novel contributions include a generalized patching algorithm for multi-threat detection, three groundbreaking hypotheses on threat interactions (e.g., threat chaining in enterprise workflows), and a deployment-ready toolkit with APIs for enterprise integration.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Prevailing methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) as text encoders rely on contrastive losses that treat the model as a black box function, discarding its generative and reasoning capabilities in favor of static embeddings. We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit, human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales. The model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/GRACE.</div>

    <div class="abstract">During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As systems trend toward superintelligence, a natural modeling premise is that agents can self-improve along every facet of their own design. We formalize this with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result identifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit, utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity criterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve learnability.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language model (LLM) agents perform well in sequential decision-making tasks, but improving them on unfamiliar domains often requires costly online interactions or fine-tuning on large expert datasets. These strategies are impractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with risks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable knowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are long, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic Feedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces into compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive steps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike prior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories, extracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting parallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting. At inference, a retriever selects relevant hints for the current state, providing targeted guidance with transparency and traceability. Experiments on MiniWoB++, WorkArena-L1, and WebArena-Lite show that JEF Hinter consistently outperforms strong baselines, including human- and document-based hints.</div>

We introduce \emph{Audit the Whisper}, a conference-grade research artifact that spans theory, benchmark design, detection, and reproducibility. Our contributions are: (i) a channel-capacity analysis showing how interventions such as paraphrase, rate limiting, and role permutation impose quantifiable capacity penalties -- operationalized via paired-run Kullback--Leibler diagnostics -- that tighten mutual-information thresholds with finite-sample guarantees; (ii) \textsc{ColludeBench}-v0, covering pricing, first-price auctions, and peer review with configurable covert schemes, deterministic manifests, and reward instrumentation; and (iii) a calibrated auditing pipeline that fuses cross-run mutual information, permutation invariance, watermark variance, and fairness-aware acceptance bias, each tuned to a \(10^{-3}\) false-positive budget. Across 600 audited runs spanning 12 intervention conditions, the union meta-test attains TPR~$=1$ with zero observed false alarms, while ablations surface the price-of-auditing trade-off and highlight fairness-driven colluders invisible to MI alone. We release regeneration scripts, seed-stamped manifests, and documentation so that external auditors can reproduce every figure and extend the framework with minimal effort.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Effective cross-functional coordination is essential for enhancing firm-wide profitability, particularly in the face of growing organizational complexity and scale. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions. We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.</div>

    <h3>Don't Pass$\mathtt{@}k$: A Bayesian Framework for Large Language Model   Evaluation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials (samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over $N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical (not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$), explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty. Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants, enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded, rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$ for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty explicit.

    <h3>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building generalist agents that can learn through online interactions. However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL, trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents. Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building \textsc{\href{https://autoglm.zhipuai.cn}{AutoGLM}}.</div>
