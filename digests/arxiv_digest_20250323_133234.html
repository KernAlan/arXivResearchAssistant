    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in designing LLM-based agents for tasks that involve interaction with human and artificial agents. This paper addresses a key aspect in the design of such agents: predicting human decisions in off-policy evaluation (OPE). We focus on language-based persuasion games, where an expert aims to influence the decision-maker through verbal messages. In our OPE framework, the prediction model is trained on human interaction data collected from encounters with one set of expert agents, and its performance is evaluated on interactions with a different set of experts. Using a dedicated application, we collected a dataset of 87K decisions from humans playing a repeated decision-making game with artificial agents. To enhance off-policy performance, we propose a simulation technique involving interactions across the entire agent space and simulated decision-makers. Our learning strategy yields significant OPE gains, e.g., improving prediction accuracy in the top 15% challenging cases by 7.1%. Our code and the large dataset we collected and generated are submitted as supplementary material and publicly available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/eilamshapira/HumanChoicePrediction</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/mathfusion.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Continual instruction tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to learn incrementally while retaining past knowledge, whereas existing methods primarily focus on how to retain old knowledge rather than on selecting which new knowledge to learn. In domain-specific contexts, maintaining data quality and managing system constraints remain key challenges. To address these issues, we propose an automated continual instruction tuning framework that dynamically filters incoming data, which identify and reduce redundant data across successive updates. Our approach utilizes a small proxy model for efficient perplexity-based filtering, and updates the proxy to ensure that the filtering criteria remain aligned with the evolving state of the deployed model. Compared to existing static data selection methods, our framework can effectively handle incrementally acquired data and shifting distributions. Additionally, it addresses practical deployment challenges by enabling seamless model updates, supporting version rollback and incorporating automatic checkpoint evaluation. We evaluated the system in real-world medical scenarios. It reduced computational costs by 66.7% and improved model performance, and achieved autonomous updates, thus demonstrating its effectiveness for automatic continual instruction tuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. However, conflicts between parametric knowledge and retrieved context pose challenges, particularly when retrieved information is unreliable or the model's internal knowledge is outdated. In such cases, LLMs struggle to determine whether to rely more on their own parameters or the conflicted context. To address this, we propose **CK-PLUG**, a plug-and-play method for controlling LLMs' reliance on parametric and contextual knowledge. We introduce a novel knowledge consistency metric, Confidence Gain, which detects knowledge conflicts by measuring entropy shifts in token probability distributions after context insertion. CK-PLUG then enables fine-grained control over knowledge preference by adjusting the probability distribution of tokens with negative confidence gain through a single tuning parameter. Experiments demonstrate CK-PLUG's ability to significantly regulate knowledge reliance in counterfactual RAG scenarios while maintaining generation fluency and knowledge accuracy. For instance, on Llama3-8B, memory recall (MR) of RAG response can be adjusted within a broad range (9.9%-71.9%), compared to the baseline of 42.1%. Moreover, CK-PLUG supports adaptive control based on the model's confidence in both internal and external knowledge, achieving consistent performance improvements across various general RAG tasks.

    <div class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, security and safety evaluation are crucial. While current red teaming approaches have made strides in assessing LLM vulnerabilities, they often rely heavily on human input and lack comprehensive coverage of emerging attack vectors. This paper introduces AutoRedTeamer, a novel framework for fully automated, end-to-end red teaming against LLMs. AutoRedTeamer combines a multi-agent architecture with a memory-guided attack selection mechanism to enable continuous discovery and integration of new attack vectors. The dual-agent framework consists of a red teaming agent that can operate from high-level risk categories alone to generate and execute test cases and a strategy proposer agent that autonomously discovers and implements new attacks by analyzing recent research. This modular design allows AutoRedTeamer to adapt to emerging threats while maintaining strong performance on existing attack vectors. We demonstrate AutoRedTeamer's effectiveness across diverse evaluation settings, achieving 20% higher attack success rates on HarmBench against Llama-3.1-70B while reducing computational costs by 46% compared to existing approaches. AutoRedTeamer also matches the diversity of human-curated benchmarks in generating test cases, providing a comprehensive, scalable, and continuously evolving framework for evaluating the security of AI systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.   In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</div>

    <div class="abstract">On-device large language models (LLMs), referring to running LLMs on edge devices, have raised considerable interest since they are more cost-effective, latency-efficient, and privacy-preserving compared with the cloud paradigm. Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We hope this article inspires researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The emergence of LLM-based agents represents a paradigm shift in AI, enabling autonomous systems to plan, reason, use tools, and maintain memory while interacting with dynamic environments. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of evaluation methodologies for these increasingly capable agents. We systematically analyze evaluation benchmarks and frameworks across four critical dimensions: (1) fundamental agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, self-reflection, and memory; (2) application-specific benchmarks for web, software engineering, scientific, and conversational agents; (3) benchmarks for generalist agents; and (4) frameworks for evaluating agents. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more realistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We also identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in assessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing fine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods. This survey maps the rapidly evolving landscape of agent evaluation, reveals the emerging trends in the field, identifies current limitations, and proposes directions for future research.</div>

    <h3>Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought: A Structured Reasoning   Optimization Framework for Long CoT Distillation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The R1 distillation scheme has emerged as a promising approach for training cost-effective models with enhanced reasoning abilities. However, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. This study examines the universality of distillation data and identifies key components that enable the efficient transfer of long-chain reasoning capabilities in LLM distillation. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of long CoT reasoning distillation from teacher models like Qwen-QwQ degrades significantly on nonhomologous models, challenging the assumed universality of current distillation methods. To gain deeper insights into the structure and patterns of long CoT reasoning, we propose DLCoT (Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought), a distillation data enhancement framework. DLCoT consists of three key steps: (1) data segmentation to decompose complex long CoT structures, (2) simplification by eliminating unsolvable and redundant solutions, and (3) optimization of intermediate error states. Our approach significantly improves model performance and token efficiency, facilitating the development of high-performance LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</div>

    <h3>Large Language Models for Water Distribution Systems Modeling and   Decision-Making</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The design, operations, and management of water distribution systems (WDS) involve complex mathematical models. These models are continually improving due to computational advancements, leading to better decision-making and more efficient WDS management. However, the significant time and effort required for modeling, programming, and analyzing results remain substantial challenges. Another issue is the professional burden, which confines the interaction with models, databases, and other sophisticated tools to a small group of experts, thereby causing non-technical stakeholders to depend on these experts or make decisions without modeling support. Furthermore, explaining model results is challenging even for experts, as it is often unclear which conditions cause the model to reach a certain state or recommend a specific policy. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) open doors for a new stage in human-model interaction. This study proposes a framework of plain language interactions with hydraulic and water quality models based on LLM-EPANET architecture. This framework is tested with increasing levels of complexity of queries to study the ability of LLMs to interact with WDS models, run complex simulations, and report simulation results. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated across several categories of queries and hyper-parameter configurations, demonstrating its potential to enhance decision-making processes in WDS management.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed from text-based assistants to autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and iteratively improving their actions. While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In large language model (LLM) reasoning, multi-step processes have proven effective for solving complex tasks. However, the depth of exploration can significantly affect the reasoning performance. Existing methods to automatically decide the depth often bring high costs and lack flexibility, and thus undermine the model's reasoning accuracy. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two metrics to capture the model's current uncertainty and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand or stop exploration according to the probability. In this way, we balance the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Entro-duction. We further conduct experiments and analysis on the components of Entro-duction to discuss their contributions to reasoning performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper explores pruning attention heads as a post-processing bias mitigation method for large language models (LLMs). Modern AI systems such as LLMs are expanding into sensitive social contexts where fairness concerns become especially crucial. Since LLMs develop decision-making patterns by training on massive datasets of human-generated content, they naturally encode and perpetuate societal biases. While modifying training datasets and algorithms is expensive and requires significant resources; post-processing techniques-such as selectively deactivating neurons and attention heads in pre-trained LLMs-can provide feasible and effective approaches to improve fairness. However, identifying the optimal subset of parameters to prune presents a combinatorial challenge within LLMs' immense parameter space, requiring solutions that efficiently balance competing objectives across the frontiers of model fairness and utility.   To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program repair approach via randomized simulated annealing. Given the prohibitive evaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural networks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states (active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics. This allows us to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify optimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly searching through the LLM parameter space. This paper introduces Attention Pruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune attention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while minimally impacting overall model utility. Our experiments show that Attention Pruning achieves up to $40\%$ reduction in gender bias and outperforms the state-of-the-art bias mitigation strategies.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.</div>

    <h3>SePer: Measure Retrieval Utility Through The Lens Of Semantic Perplexity   Reduction</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text embeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</div>
