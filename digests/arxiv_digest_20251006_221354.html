    <div class="abstract">Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge. However, standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, often fails to capture the interconnected nature of information required for complex, multi-hop reasoning. While structured RAG methods attempt to address this using knowledge graphs built from triples, we argue that the inherent context loss of triples (context collapse) limits the fidelity of the knowledge representation. We introduce PropRAG, a novel RAG framework that shifts from triples to context-rich propositions and introduces an efficient, LLM-free online beam search over proposition paths to discover multi-step reasoning chains. By coupling a higher-fidelity knowledge representation with explicit path discovery, PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 and F1 scores on 2Wiki, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, advancing non-parametric knowledge integration by improving evidence retrieval through richer representation and efficient reasoning path discovery.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Existing large language model (LLM) agents for automating data science show promise, but they remain constrained by narrow task scopes, limited generalization across tasks and models, and over-reliance on state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We introduce DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework for adaptive and robust data science automation. Inspired by how human data scientists work in computational notebooks, DatawiseAgent introduces a unified interaction representation and a multi-stage architecture based on finite-state transducers (FSTs). This design enables flexible long-horizon planning, progressive solution development, and robust recovery from execution failures. Extensive experiments across diverse data science scenarios and models show that DatawiseAgent consistently achieves SOTA performance by surpassing strong baselines such as AutoGen and TaskWeaver, demonstrating superior effectiveness and adaptability. Further evaluations reveal graceful performance degradation under weaker or smaller models, underscoring the robustness and scalability.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose, pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to 20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining, we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for future extensions and improvements.

    <div class="abstract">With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing \underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with \underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer, filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.</div>

    <h3>Untargeted Jailbreak Attack</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response. However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low attack efficiency.   To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that \textsc{UJA} can achieve over 80\% attack success rates against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and COLD-Attack by over 20\%.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.   The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines.</div>

    <h3>FinReflectKG -- MultiHop: Financial QA Benchmark for Reasoning with   Knowledge Graph Evidence</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Multi-hop reasoning over financial disclosures is often a retrieval problem before it becomes a reasoning or generation problem: relevant facts are dispersed across sections, filings, companies, and years, and LLMs often expend excessive tokens navigating noisy context. Without precise Knowledge Graph (KG)-guided selection of relevant context, even strong reasoning models either fail to answer or consume excessive tokens, whereas KG-linked evidence enables models to focus their reasoning on composing already retrieved facts. We present FinReflectKG - MultiHop, a benchmark built on FinReflectKG, a temporally indexed financial KG that links audited triples to source chunks from S&P 100 filings (2022-2024). Mining frequent 2-3 hop subgraph patterns across sectors (via GICS taxonomy), we generate financial analyst style questions with exact supporting evidence from the KG. A two-phase pipeline first creates QA pairs via pattern-specific prompts, followed by a multi-criteria quality control evaluation to ensure QA validity. We then evaluate three controlled retrieval scenarios: (S1) precise KG-linked paths; (S2) text-only page windows centered on relevant text spans; and (S3) relevant page windows with randomizations and distractors. Across both reasoning and non-reasoning models, KG-guided precise retrieval yields substantial gains on the FinReflectKG - MultiHop QA benchmark dataset, boosting correctness scores by approximately 24 percent while reducing token utilization by approximately 84.5 percent compared to the page window setting, which reflects the traditional vector retrieval paradigm. Spanning intra-document, inter-year, and cross-company scopes, our work underscores the pivotal role of knowledge graphs in efficiently connecting evidence for multi-hop financial QA. We also release a curated subset of the benchmark (555 QA Pairs) to catalyze further research.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing $6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based verifiers.</div>

    <h3>To Compress or Not? Pushing the Frontier of Lossless GenAI Model Weights   Compression with Exponent Concentration</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.</div>

    <h3>HALO: Memory-Centric Heterogeneous Accelerator with 2.5D Integration for   Low-Batch LLM Inference</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a growing demand for efficient inference, particularly in latency-sensitive applications such as chatbots and personalized assistants. Unlike traditional deep neural networks, LLM inference proceeds in two distinct phases: the prefill phase, which processes the full input sequence in parallel, and the decode phase, which generates tokens sequentially. These phases exhibit highly diverse compute and memory requirements, which makes accelerator design particularly challenging. Prior works have primarily been optimized for high-batch inference or evaluated only short input context lengths, leaving the low-batch and long context regime, which is critical for interactive applications, largely underexplored.   We propose HALO, a heterogeneous memory centric accelerator designed for these unique challenges of prefill and decode phases in low-batch LLM inference. HALO integrates HBM based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) with an on-chip analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM), co-packaged using 2.5D integration. To further improve the hardware utilization, we introduce a phase-aware mapping strategy that adapts to the distinct demands of the prefill and decode phases. Compute bound operations in the prefill phase are mapped to CiM to exploit its high throughput matrix multiplication capability, while memory-bound operations in the decode phase are executed on CiD to benefit from reduced data movement within DRAM. Additionally, we present an analysis of the performance tradeoffs of LLMs under two architectural extremes: a fully CiD and a fully on-chip analog CiM design to highlight the need for a heterogeneous design. We evaluate HALO on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models. Our experimental results show that LLMs mapped to HALO achieve up to 18x geometric mean speedup over AttAcc, an attention-optimized mapping and 2.5x over CENT, a fully CiD based mapping.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models frequently generate harmful recommendations in personal multi-turn dialogue by ignoring user-specific safety context, exhibiting sycophantic agreement, and compromising user safety for larger group preferences. We introduce MIRROR, a modular production-focused architecture that prevents these failures through a persistent, bounded internal state that preserves personal conversational information across conversational turns. Our dual-component design inspired by Dual Process Theory separates immediate response generation (Talker) from asynchronous deliberative processing (Thinker), which synthesizes parallel reasoning threads between turns with marginal latency. On the CuRaTe personalized safety benchmark, MIRROR-augmented models achieve a 21% relative improvement (69% to 84%) across seven diverse frontier models, with open-source Llama 4 and Mistral 3 variants surpassing both GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet at only \$0.0028 to \$0.0172 additional cost per turn, narrowing the gap between affordable open-source models to frontier systems in the safety space. The modular architecture enables flexible deployment: full internal processing for affordable models or single-component configurations for expensive systems, democratizing access to safer, personalized AI.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The current paradigm of AI model distribution presents a fundamental dichotomy: models are either closed and API-gated, sacrificing transparency and local execution, or openly distributed, sacrificing monetization and control. We introduce OML(Open-access, Monetizable, and Loyal AI Model Serving), a primitive that enables a new distribution paradigm where models can be freely distributed for local execution while maintaining cryptographically enforced usage authorization. We are the first to introduce and formalize this problem, introducing rigorous security definitions tailored to the unique challenge of white-box model protection: model extraction resistance and permission forgery resistance. We prove fundamental bounds on the achievability of OML properties and characterize the complete design space of potential constructions, from obfuscation-based approaches to cryptographic solutions. To demonstrate practical feasibility, we present OML 1.0, a novel OML construction leveraging AI-native model fingerprinting coupled with crypto-economic enforcement mechanisms. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we establish OML as a foundational primitive necessary for sustainable AI ecosystems. This work opens a new research direction at the intersection of cryptography, machine learning, and mechanism design, with critical implications for the future of AI distribution and governance.</div>

Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</div>

    <h3>Dissecting Transformers: A CLEAR Perspective towards Green AI</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology, Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP), indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient transformer models through component-level optimizations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .</div>

    <h3>Automated Constraint Specification for Job Scheduling by Regulating   Generative Model with Domain-Specific Representation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive. Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint specification tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their application in recommender systems remains limited by reasoning opacity and knowledge constraints. This paper introduces AgenticRAG, a novel framework that combines tool-augmented foundation models with retrieval-augmented generation for zero-shot explainable recommendations. Our approach integrates external tool invocation, knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning to create autonomous recommendation agents capable of transparent decision-making without task-specific training. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\% on Amazon Electronics, 0.8\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\% on Yelp datasets. The framework exhibits superior explainability while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to traditional methods.</div>
