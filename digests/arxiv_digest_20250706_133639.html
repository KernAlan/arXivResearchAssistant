    <h3>Knowledge Protocol Engineering: A New Paradigm for AI in Domain-Specific   Knowledge Work</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol (KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.</div>

    <h3>Gradient-Based Model Fingerprinting for LLM Similarity Detection and   Family Classification</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to verify compliance.   To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94% classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens. To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose $\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.</div>

    <h3>FlowSpec: Continuous Pipelined Speculative Decoding for Efficient   Distributed LLM Inference</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose \textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared to baselines.

    <div class="abstract">Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence, reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation, they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization, and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and "non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process. This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this, we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by 36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing. Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token cost.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7 security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks, including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively. Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution, leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage specialized expertise for different types of information processing. Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution for multi-step information seeking tasks.

    <div class="abstract">Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly, requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation. However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations. Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic heuristic evaluations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward \textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and \textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately $1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking. Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial implementation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation. The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher data quality.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets for supervised fine-tuning. Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across diverse tasks.</div>

    <h3>Aligning Frozen LLMs by Reinforcement Learning: An Iterative   Reweight-then-Optimize Approach</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible. In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions, and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications. These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and explicit definitions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Postprandial hyperglycemia, marked by the blood glucose level exceeding the normal range after consuming a meal, is a critical indicator of progression toward type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes and in healthy individuals. A key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the postprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance based on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity level, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could allow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal glucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning solution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data processing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to predict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and recent glucose patterns. We used data obtained from wearables in a five-week clinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the proposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data, and machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from wearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work logs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose pattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology provides a 16% better performance level compared to the comparison models. Additionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 73.3% and an F1 score of 0.716 and recommends different treatment options to help avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations.
