    <h3>Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenge, particularly in engineering applications where precision and reliability are critical. While fine-tuning and prompting methods can modify model behavior, they lack the dynamic and exact control necessary for engineering applications. Inference-time intervention techniques provide a promising alternative, allowing targeted adjustments to LLM outputs. In this work, we demonstrate how interventions enable fine-grained control for automating the usually time-intensive requirement verification process in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Using two early-stage Capella SysML models of space missions with associated requirements, we apply the intervened LLMs to reason over a graph representation of the model to determine whether a requirement is fulfilled. Our method achieves robust and reliable outputs, significantly improving over both a baseline model and a fine-tuning approach. By identifying and modifying as few as one to three specialised attention heads, we can significantly change the model's behavior. When combined with self-consistency, this allows us to achieve perfect precision on our holdout test set.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly growing in industry and academia for various software engineering (SE) tasks. As these models become more integral to critical processes, ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness becomes essential. Consequently, the concept of trust in these systems is becoming increasingly critical. Well-calibrated trust is important, as excessive trust can lead to security vulnerabilities, and risks, while insufficient trust can hinder innovation. However, the landscape of trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE is relatively unclear, with concepts such as trust, distrust, and trustworthiness lacking clear conceptualizations in the SE community. To bring clarity to the current research status and identify opportunities for future work, we conducted a comprehensive review of $88$ papers: a systematic literature review of $18$ papers focused on LLMs in SE, complemented by an analysis of 70 papers from broader trust literature. Additionally, we conducted a survey study with 25 domain experts to gain insights into practitioners' understanding of trust and identify gaps between existing literature and developers' perceptions. The result of our analysis serves as a roadmap that covers trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE and highlights areas for future exploration.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper presents INPROVF, an automatic framework that combines large language models (LLMs) and formal methods to speed up the repair process of high-level robot controllers. Previous approaches based solely on formal methods are computationally expensive and cannot scale to large state spaces. In contrast, INPROVF uses LLMs to generate repair candidates, and formal methods to verify their correctness. To improve the quality of these candidates, our framework first translates the symbolic representations of the environment and controllers into natural language descriptions. If a candidate fails the verification, INPROVF provides feedback on potential unsafe behaviors or unsatisfied tasks, and iteratively prompts LLMs to generate improved solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of INPROVF through 12 violations with various workspaces, tasks, and state space sizes.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In machine learning (ML), it is common to account for multiple objectives when, e.g., selecting a model to deploy. However, it is often unclear how one should compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives, as they might be measured in different units or scales. For example, when deploying large language models (LLMs), we might not only care about their performance, but also their CO2 consumption. In this work, we investigate how objectives can be sensibly compared and aggregated to navigate their Pareto front. To do so, we propose to make incomparable objectives comparable via their CDFs, approximated by their relative rankings. This allows us to aggregate them while matching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully navigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the potential impact of our methodology in diverse areas such as LLM selection, domain generalization, and AutoML benchmarking, where classical ways to aggregate and normalize objectives fail.</div>

    <h3>KG-IRAG: A Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented   Generation Framework for Temporal Reasoning</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With the accelerated development of Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing systems increasingly require efficient task allocation and scheduling in multi-robot systems. However, existing methods rely on domain expertise and face challenges in adapting to dynamic production constraints. Additionally, enterprises have high privacy requirements for production scheduling data, which prevents the use of cloud-based large language models (LLMs) for solution development. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for an automated modeling solution that meets data privacy requirements. This study proposes a knowledge-augmented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) automated formulation framework, integrating local LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases to generate executable code from natural language descriptions automatically. The framework employs a knowledge-guided DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model to extract complex spatiotemporal constraints (82% average accuracy) and leverages a supervised fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model for efficient MILP code generation (90% average accuracy). Experimental results demonstrate that the framework successfully achieves automatic modeling in the aircraft skin manufacturing case while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. This research provides a low-barrier and highly reliable technical path for modeling in complex industrial scenarios.</div>

    <h3>Can Language Models Follow Multiple Turns of Entangled Instructions?</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 9/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Despite significant achievements in improving the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple potentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable challenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple instructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and prioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple turns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or conflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities in handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of difficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and reasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We construct MultiTurnInstruct with around 1.1K high-quality multi-turn conversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine capability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and multitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different capabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show reduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective information withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities but still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these performance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models demonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks but their attention mechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These findings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks involving multi-turn instructions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) possess encompassing capabilities that can process diverse language-related tasks. However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(ASR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect retention of prior knowledge while seamlessly integrating new information, effectively overcoming the core limitations of existing methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show significant improvements in classification accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability for multi-label skill classification. Our results indicate that the framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, offering a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</div>

Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

    <div class="abstract">Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present RWKV-7 "Goose", a new sequence modeling architecture, along with pre-trained language models that establish a new state-of-the-art in downstream performance at the 3 billion parameter scale on multilingual tasks, and match current SoTA English language performance despite being trained on dramatically fewer tokens than other top 3B models. Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.   To foster openness, reproduction, and adoption, we release our models and dataset component listing at https://huggingface.co/RWKV, and our training and inference code at https://github.com/RWKV/RWKV-LM all under the Apache 2.0 License.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Time series data measure how environments change over time and drive decision-making in critical domains like finance and healthcare. When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

    <div class="abstract">Large Language models have demonstrated excellent domain-specific question-answering capabilities when finetuned with a particular dataset of that specific domain. However, fine-tuning the models requires a significant amount of training time and a considerable amount of hardware. In this work, we propose CARE (Customer Assistance and Response Engine), a lightweight model made by fine-tuning Phi3.5-mini on very minimal hardware and data, designed to handle queries primarily across three domains: telecommunications support, medical support, and banking support. For telecommunications and banking, the chatbot addresses issues and problems faced by customers regularly in the above-mentioned domains. In the medical domain, CARE provides preliminary support by offering basic diagnoses and medical suggestions that a user might take before consulting a healthcare professional. Since CARE is built on Phi3.5-mini, it can be used even on mobile devices, increasing its usability. Our research also shows that CARE performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Leading large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning-intensive tasks, such as standardized educational testing. However, they often require extensive training in low-resource settings with inaccessible infrastructure. Small or compact models, though more efficient, frequently lack sufficient support for underrepresented languages, leaving a performance gap in critical domains. This work explores the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning of compact open-weight language models to handle reasoning-intensive tasks in the underrepresented Ukrainian language, building on the findings of the ZNO-Eval benchmark. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLaMA 3.1 (8 billion parameters), LLaMA 3.2 (3 billion parameters), and Gemma 2 (9 billion parameters) models on chain-of-thought solutions resulted in a modest test score improvement of up to 17.4% on complex matching tasks and 1.6% overall compared to tuning on answer letters alone, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness. In addition, the proposed tuning method with joint task topic and step-by-step solution generation outperforms standard chain-of-thought tuning in matching tasks and provides a 5.4% gain over the best LLaMA 3.2 model due to guiding the model to recall and apply domain-relevant information. Contrasting obtained results with zero-shot evaluations of leading open-weight and proprietary models such as Qwen, DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o1 and o3, Gemini, and Claude, highlight that fine-tuning LLaMA and Gemma models with 2,032 step-by-step solutions and 20 to 50 million trainable parameters on a single A100 GPU lets them outperform GPT-4o mini, Mistral Large, and larger open-weight models. This research also evaluates how merging the quantized adapter with the base model influences the generation quality.

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have been one of the most important discoveries in machine learning in recent years. LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, such as ChatGPT, have consistently attracted the attention from researchers, investors, and the general public, driving the rapid growth of this industry. With the frequent introduction of new LLMs to the market, it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between them, creating a demand for new LLM comparison methods.   In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework (ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed. It compares texts generated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall degree of similarity between their responses. The main advantage of this framework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as chatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose any information about their product.   To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying similarities between multiple LLMs are conducted. Additionally, these experiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by ConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking techniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot LLM comparison scenario.   The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of multiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component analysis (PCA). The ConSCompF output may provide useful insights into data that might have been used during LLM training and help detect possible investment fraud attempts.</div>

    <h3>MDTeamGPT: A Self-Evolving LLM-based Multi-Agent Framework for   Multi-Disciplinary Team Medical Consultation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various fields. However, challenges remain in Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) medical consultations. Current research enhances reasoning through role assignment, task decomposition, and accumulation of medical experience. Multi-role collaboration in MDT consultations often results in excessively long dialogue histories. This increases the model's cognitive burden and degrades both efficiency and accuracy. Some methods only store treatment histories. They do not extract effective experience or reflect on errors. This limits knowledge generalization and system evolution. We propose a multi-agent MDT medical consultation framework based on LLMs to address these issues. Our framework uses consensus aggregation and a residual discussion structure for multi-round consultations. It also employs a Correct Answer Knowledge Base (CorrectKB) and a Chain-of-Thought Knowledge Base (ChainKB) to accumulate consultation experience. These mechanisms enable the framework to evolve and continually improve diagnosis rationality and accuracy. Experimental results on the MedQA and PubMedQA datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves accuracies of 90.1% and 83.9%, respectively, and that the constructed knowledge bases generalize effectively across test sets from both datasets.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of integrated systems that merge computational prowess with human decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textbf{Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence (ODI)}, a novel paradigm that reconceptualizes AI not as isolated autonomous agents, but as cohesive, orchestrated networks that work in tandem with human expertise. ODI leverages advanced orchestration layers, multi-loop feedback mechanisms, and a high cognitive density framework to transform static, record-keeping systems into dynamic, action-oriented environments. Through a comprehensive review of multi-agent system literature, recent technological advances, and practical insights from industry forums, we argue that the future of AI lies in integrating distributed intelligence within human-centric workflows. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency and strategic agility but also addresses challenges related to scalability, transparency, and ethical decision-making. Our work outlines key theoretical implications and presents a practical roadmap for future research and enterprise innovation, aiming to pave the way for responsible and adaptive AI systems that drive sustainable innovation in human organizations.</div>
