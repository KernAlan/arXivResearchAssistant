    <div class="abstract">Autonomous LLM-based agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for complex task execution, yet the field lacks standardized tools for development, deployment, distribution and discovery of agents. We present Cerebrum, an Agent SDK for AIOS that addresses this gap through three key components: (1) a comprehensive SDK featuring a modular four-layer architecture for agent development, encompassing LLM, memory, storage, and tool management; (2) a community-driven Agent Hub for sharing and discovering agents, complete with version control and dependency management; (3) an interactive web interface for testing and evaluating agents. The platform's effectiveness is demonstrated through implementations of various agent architectures, including Chain of Thought (CoT), ReAct, and tool-use agents. Cerebrum advances the field by providing a unified framework that standardizes agent development while maintaining flexibility for researchers and developers to innovate and distribute their agents.

    <div class="abstract">Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The increasing amount of pressure related to water and energy shortages has increased the urgency of cultivating individual conservation behaviors. While the concept of nudging, i.e., providing usage-based feedback, has shown promise in encouraging conservation behaviors, its efficacy is often constrained by the lack of targeted and actionable content. This study investigates the impact of the use of large language models (LLMs) to provide tailored conservation suggestions for conservation intentions and their rationale. Through a survey experiment with 1,515 university participants, we compare three virtual nudging scenarios: no nudging, traditional nudging with usage statistics, and LLM-powered nudging with usage statistics and personalized conservation suggestions. The results of statistical analyses and causal forest modeling reveal that nudging led to an increase in conservation intentions among 86.9%-98.0% of the participants. LLM-powered nudging achieved a maximum increase of 18.0% in conservation intentions, surpassing traditional nudging by 88.6%. Furthermore, structural equation modeling results reveal that exposure to LLM-powered nudges enhances self-efficacy and outcome expectations while diminishing dependence on social norms, thereby increasing intrinsic motivation to conserve. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in promoting individual water and energy conservation, representing a new frontier in the design of sustainable behavioral interventions and resource management.</div>

Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the potential of UniTranslator to overcome the limitations of existing approaches and unlock the power of smaller LLMs for complex code translation tasks. We explore the effectiveness of this dynamic multi-agent paradigm in handling diverse language pairs, including low-resource languages, and in mitigating common issues such as code artifacts and hallucinations through the use of Natural Language Inference (NLI) grounding and iterative feedback mechanisms</div>

    <div class="abstract">Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), functioning as a whole to guide these models in generating reasoning steps toward final answers. However, we observe that isolated segments, words, or tokens within CoT demonstrations can unexpectedly disrupt the generation process of LLMs. The model may overly concentrate on certain local information present in the demonstration, introducing irrelevant noise into the reasoning process and potentially leading to incorrect answers. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanism of CoT through dynamically tracing and manipulating the inner workings of LLMs at each output step, which demonstrates that tokens exhibiting specific attention characteristics are more likely to induce the model to take things out of context; these tokens directly attend to the hidden states tied with prediction, without substantial integration of non-local information. Building upon these insights, we propose a Few-shot Attention Intervention method (FAI) that dynamically analyzes the attention patterns of demonstrations to accurately identify these tokens and subsequently make targeted adjustments to the attention weights to effectively suppress their distracting effect on LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, with a remarkable 5.91% improvement on the AQuA dataset, further highlighting the effectiveness of FAI.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Precision therapeutics require multimodal adaptive models that generate personalized treatment recommendations. We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning. TxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions. By integrating multi-step inference, real-time knowledge grounding, and tool-assisted decision-making, TxAgent ensures that treatment recommendations align with established clinical guidelines and real-world evidence, reducing the risk of adverse events and improving therapeutic decision-making.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%, depending on its skill composition.</div>

    <h3>Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models: A Survey</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are leading a new technological revolution as one of the most promising research streams toward artificial general intelligence. The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the number of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been linked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved. These emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context learning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific debate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors, such as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What underlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential, emergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about their definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we shed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the phenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world consequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing inconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the conditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling laws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting strategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and inference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However, emergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning capabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception, manipulation, and reward hacking. We highlight growing concerns about safety and governance, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks and regulatory oversight.</div>

    <h3>Dynamic-Width Speculative Beam Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 9/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across numerous real-world tasks. However, the autoregressive nature of these models makes the inference process slow and costly. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging a smaller auxiliary model to draft future tokens, which are then validated simultaneously by the larger model, achieving a speed-up of 1-2x. Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution as multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal outputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing higher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each step. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with beam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate multiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences from the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to balance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple drafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in beam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width speculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel draft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the large model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small model. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number of beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness. Besides, we extend tree-based parallel verification to handle multiple trees simultaneously, accelerating the verification process. Finally, we illustrate a simple modification to our algorithm to mitigate the memory overhead of beam sampling...</div>

    <div class="abstract">In the pursuit of fully autonomous robotic systems capable of taking over tasks traditionally performed by humans, the complexity of open-world environments poses a considerable challenge. Addressing this imperative, this study contributes to the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to task and motion planning for robots. We propose a system architecture that orchestrates a seamless interplay between multiple cognitive levels, encompassing reasoning, planning, and motion generation. At its core lies a novel replanning strategy that handles physically grounded, logical, and semantic errors in the generated plans. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed feedback architecture, particularly its impact on executability, correctness, and time complexity via empirical evaluation in the context of a simulation and two intricate real-world scenarios: blocks world, barman and pizza preparation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which use crafted prompts to elicit toxic responses. These attacks exploit LLMs' difficulty in dynamically detecting harmful intents during the generation process. Traditional safety alignment methods, often relying on the initial few generation steps, are ineffective due to limited computational budget. This paper proposes DEEPALIGN, a robust defense framework that fine-tunes LLMs to progressively detoxify generated content, significantly improving both the computational budget and effectiveness of mitigating harmful generation. Our approach uses a hybrid loss function operating on hidden states to directly improve LLMs' inherent awareness of toxity during generation. Furthermore, we redefine safe responses by generating semantically relevant answers to harmful queries, thereby increasing robustness against representation-mutation attacks. Evaluations across multiple LLMs demonstrate state-of-the-art defense performance against six different attack types, reducing Attack Success Rates by up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art defense while preserving utility. This work advances LLM safety by addressing limitations of conventional alignment through dynamic, context-aware mitigation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made groundbreaking progress in embodied intelligence, they still face significant challenges in spatial reasoning for complex long-horizon tasks. To address this gap, we propose EmbodiedVSR (Embodied Visual Spatial Reasoning), a novel framework that integrates dynamic scene graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance spatial understanding for embodied agents. By explicitly constructing structured knowledge representations through dynamic scene graphs, our method enables zero-shot spatial reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning. This approach not only disentangles intricate spatial relationships but also aligns reasoning steps with actionable environmental dynamics. To rigorously evaluate performance, we introduce the eSpatial-Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset including real-world embodied scenarios with fine-grained spatial annotations and adaptive task difficulty levels. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing MLLM-based methods in accuracy and reasoning coherence, particularly in long-horizon tasks requiring iterative environment interaction. The results reveal the untapped potential of MLLMs for embodied intelligence when equipped with structured, explainable reasoning mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable deployment in real-world spatial applications. The codes and datasets will be released soon.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) signifies a paradigm shift toward advanced computational reasoning. Yet, this progress disrupts traditional agent frameworks, traditionally anchored by execution-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). To explore this transformation, we propose the LaRMA framework, encompassing nine tasks across Tool Usage, Plan Design, and Problem Solving, assessed with three top LLMs (e.g., Claude3.5-sonnet) and five leading LRMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Our findings address four research questions: LRMs surpass LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks like Plan Design, leveraging iterative reflection for superior outcomes; LLMs excel in execution-driven tasks such as Tool Usage, prioritizing efficiency; hybrid LLM-LRM configurations, pairing LLMs as actors with LRMs as reflectors, optimize agent performance by blending execution speed with reasoning depth; and LRMs' enhanced reasoning incurs higher computational costs, prolonged processing, and behavioral challenges, including overthinking and fact-ignoring tendencies. This study fosters deeper inquiry into LRMs' balance of deep thinking and overthinking, laying a critical foundation for future agent design advancements.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Long-form video understanding is complicated by the high redundancy of video data and the abundance of query-irrelevant information. To tackle these challenges, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a query-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over long-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the input video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection of keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is often overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate multi-granularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing VideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide range of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree aggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree structure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our experiments show that our method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms existing training-free approaches on EgoSchema and NExT-QA with less inference time, achieving 61.1% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training. Moreover, on the long split of Video-MME (average 44 minutes), VideoTree achieves better performance than GPT-4V and many other MLLMs that were extensively trained on video data.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Prompt injection constitutes a significant challenge for generative AI systems by inducing unintended outputs. We introduce a multi-agent NLP framework specifically designed to address prompt injection vulnerabilities through layered detection and enforcement mechanisms. The framework orchestrates specialized agents for generating responses, sanitizing outputs, and enforcing policy compliance. Evaluation on 500 engineered injection prompts demonstrates a marked reduction in injection success and policy breaches. Novel metrics, including Injection Success Rate (ISR), Policy Override Frequency (POF), Prompt Sanitization Rate (PSR), and Compliance Consistency Score (CCS), are proposed to derive a composite Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS). The system utilizes the OVON (Open Voice Network) framework for inter-agent communication via structured JSON messages, extending a previously established multi-agent architecture from hallucination mitigation to address the unique challenges of prompt injection.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Huawei has always been committed to exploring the AI application in historical research. Biography generation, as a specialized form of abstractive summarization, plays a crucial role in historical research but faces unique challenges that existing large language models (LLMs) struggle to address. These challenges include maintaining stylistic adherence to historical writing conventions, ensuring factual fidelity, and handling fragmented information across multiple documents. We present AIstorian, a novel end-to-end agentic system featured with a knowledge graph (KG)-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and anti-hallucination multi-agents. Specifically, AIstorian introduces an in-context learning based chunking strategy and a KG-based index for accurate and efficient reference retrieval. Meanwhile, AIstorian orchestrates multi-agents to conduct on-the-fly hallucination detection and error-type-aware correction. Additionally, to teach LLMs a certain language style, we finetune LLMs based on a two-step training approach combining data augmentation-enhanced supervised fine-tuning with stylistic preference optimization. Extensive experiments on a real-life historical Jinshi dataset demonstrate that AIstorian achieves a 3.8x improvement in factual accuracy and a 47.6% reduction in hallucination rate compared to existing baselines.

    <h3>MoLEx: Mixture of Layer Experts for Finetuning with Sparse Upcycling</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large-scale pre-training of deep models, followed by fine-tuning them, has become the cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP). The prevalence of data coupled with computational resources has led to large models with a considerable number of parameters. While the massive size of these models has led to remarkable success in many NLP tasks, a detriment is the expense required to retrain all the base model's parameters for the adaptation to each task or domain. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides an effective solution for this challenge by minimizing the number of parameters required to be fine-tuned while maintaining the quality of the model. While existing methods have achieved impressive results, they mainly focus on adapting a subset of parameters, weight reparameterization, and prompt engineering. In this paper, we study layers as extractors of different types of linguistic information that are valuable when used in conjunction. We then propose the Mixture of Layer Experts (MoLEx), a novel sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) whose experts are layers in the pre-trained model. It performs a conditional computation of a mixture of layers during fine-tuning to provide the model with more structural knowledge about the data. By providing an avenue for information exchange between layers, MoLEx enables the model to make a more well-informed prediction for the downstream task, leading to better fine-tuning results with the same number of effective parameters. As experts can be processed in parallel, MoLEx introduces minimal additional computational overhead. We empirically corroborate the advantages of MoLEx when combined with popular PEFT baseline methods on a variety of downstream fine-tuning tasks, including the popular GLUE benchmark as well as the End-to-End Challenge (E2E). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/rachtsy/molex.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have brought great potential but also posed new risks. For example, LLMs with knowledge of bioweapons, advanced chemistry, or cyberattacks could cause violence if placed in the wrong hands or during malfunctions. Because of their nature as near-black boxes, intuitive interpretation of LLM internals remains an open research question, preventing developers from easily controlling model behavior and capabilities. The use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) has recently emerged as a potential method of unraveling representations of concepts in LLMs internals, and has allowed developers to steer model outputs by directly modifying the hidden activations. In this paper, we use SAEs to identify unwanted concepts from the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) dataset within gemma-2-2b internals and use feature steering to reduce the model's ability to answer harmful questions while retaining its performance on harmless queries. Our results bring back optimism to the viability of SAE-based explicit knowledge unlearning techniques.</div>
