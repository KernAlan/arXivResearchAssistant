        <h3>ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights</h3>
        Hey boss, I found 5 cool papers today that I think you'll love:

<ol>
<li>Researchers evaluated how well large language models (LLMs) handle retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks. They discovered that while RAG generally boosts performance, its effectiveness varies based on the number of retrieved documents and their order. This is super relevant for our future projects, as it helps identify when RAG can be more beneficial and how to optimize it for better results.</li>

<li>A team introduced LaMDAgent, a smart framework that automates the optimization of post-training pipelines for LLMs. This could save us a ton of time and effort by reducing the need for manual tweaks and allowing us to explore various model configurations automatically to find the best setups. Definitely a game-changer for fine-tuning models!</li>

<li>Check out R1-Code-Interpreter, which trains LLMs to reason with code more effectively. By combining supervised and reinforcement learning, this model significantly improves its ability to solve complex tasks that require algorithmic reasoning. This could enhance our models' coding capabilities, making them much more reliable for coding-related tasks.</li>

<li>3DLLM-Mem focuses on giving LLMs long-term memory for navigating complex 3D environments. By using a dynamic memory management system, it achieves impressive results in spatial-temporal reasoning. This could really enhance the way our models interact in dynamic settings, making them smarter and more efficient in real-world applications.</li>

<li>Lastly, there's Fusion Steering, which improves the accuracy of LLMs in question-answering tasks by dynamically adjusting activations across transformer layers. This approach allows for more flexible and contextually aware responses. It could be a solid addition to our toolset for enhancing the factual accuracy of our models!</li>
</ol>

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any of these!

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) generally enhances large language models' (LLMs) ability to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. But RAG may also lead to performance degradation due to imperfect retrieval and the model's limited ability to leverage retrieved content. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs in practical RAG setups (henceforth retrieval robustness). We focus on three research questions: (1) whether RAG is always better than non-RAG; (2) whether more retrieved documents always lead to better performance; (3) and whether document orders impact results. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark of 1500 open-domain questions, each with retrieved documents from Wikipedia. We introduce three robustness metrics, each corresponds to one research question. Our comprehensive experiments, involving 11 LLMs and 3 prompting strategies, reveal that all of these LLMs exhibit surprisingly high retrieval robustness; nonetheless, different degrees of imperfect robustness hinders them from fully utilizing the benefits of RAG.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.</div>

    <h3>R1-Code-Interpreter: Training LLMs to Reason with Code via Supervised   and Reinforcement Learning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Despite advances in reasoning and planning of R1-like models, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with tasks requiring precise computation, symbolic manipulation, optimization, and algorithmic reasoning, in which textual reasoning lacks the rigor of code execution. A key challenge is enabling LLMs to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. While OpenAI trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and generalize across diverse tasks. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107 for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies, investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models, cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs. Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to 64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code generation.

    <div class="abstract">Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</div>

    <h3>Fusion Steering: Prompt-Specific Activation Control</h3>

    <div class="abstract">We present Fusion Steering, an activation steering methodology that improves factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA) tasks. This approach introduces flexible steering configurations, including full-layer steering and segmented steering. Unlike traditional methods constrained to single-layer or fixed-layer operations, Fusion Steering employs dynamic injection of prompt-specific activation deltas across all transformer layers. These activation deltas are derived from reference completions that combine the ground-truth answer with a model-generated explanation to facilitate semantically enriched, example-specific steering. The injection weights are optimized per prompt using Optuna, targeting a joint objective that balances token overlap (factual alignment) and perplexity (fluency proxy). Evaluation employs a composite score integrating token overlap and LLM-graded quality, encompassing factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance. Empirical results on 260 SimpleQA prompts (selected from 500 where the baseline failed) showcase the efficacy of segmented steering. Using Gemma-2-2B-IT with 8-bit quantization, segmented steering achieves an accuracy of 25.4% (outputs scoring $\geq 0.6$), outperforming the baseline at 3.5% and full-layer steering at 16.2%. Under the stricter SimpleQA rubric, segmented steering boosts fully correct responses from 0.0% to 13.1%. These findings highlight the strengths of segmented, dynamic intervention strategies and the promise of per-prompt, full-network activation control. Fusion Steering is also amenable to sparse representations, such as Neuronpedia or sparse crosscoders, suggesting a promising direction for interpretable and scalable activation-level control in LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present Thinking with Generated Images, a novel paradigm that fundamentally transforms how large multimodal models (LMMs) engage with visual reasoning by enabling them to natively think across text and vision modalities through spontaneous generation of intermediate visual thinking steps. Current visual reasoning with LMMs is constrained to either processing fixed user-provided images or reasoning solely through text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). Thinking with Generated Images unlocks a new dimension of cognitive capability where models can actively construct intermediate visual thoughts, critique their own visual hypotheses, and refine them as integral components of their reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two complementary mechanisms: (1) vision generation with intermediate visual subgoals, where models decompose complex visual tasks into manageable components that are generated and integrated progressively, and (2) vision generation with self-critique, where models generate an initial visual hypothesis, analyze its shortcomings through textual reasoning, and produce refined outputs based on their own critiques. Our experiments on vision generation benchmarks show substantial improvements over baseline approaches, with our models achieving up to 50% (from 38% to 57%) relative improvement in handling complex multi-object scenarios. From biochemists exploring novel protein structures, and architects iterating on spatial designs, to forensic analysts reconstructing crime scenes, and basketball players envisioning strategic plays, our approach enables AI models to engage in the kind of visual imagination and iterative refinement that characterizes human creative, analytical, and strategic thinking.

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks. Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents, communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.</div>

    <h3>Budget-Adaptive Adapter Tuning in Orthogonal Subspaces for Continual   Learning in LLMs</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment. To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows necessitates efficient Key-Value Cache (KVC) management to optimize inference performance. Inference workloads like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agents exhibit high cache reusability, making efficient caching critical to reducing redundancy and improving speed. We analyze real-world KVC access patterns using publicly available traces and evaluate commercial key-value stores like Redis and state-of-the-art RDMA-based systems (CHIME [1] and Sherman [2]) for KVC metadata management. Our work demonstrates the lack of tailored storage solution for KVC prefilling, underscores the need for an efficient distributed caching system with optimized metadata management for LLM workloads, and provides insights into designing improved KVC management systems for scalable, low-latency inference.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Traditional search engines struggle to synthesize fragmented information for complex queries, while generative AI search engines face challenges in relevance, comprehensiveness, and presentation. To address these limitations, we introduce Xinyu AI Search, a novel system that incorporates a query-decomposition graph to dynamically break down complex queries into sub-queries, enabling stepwise retrieval and generation. Our retrieval pipeline enhances diversity through multi-source aggregation and query expansion, while filtering and re-ranking strategies optimize passage relevance. Additionally, Xinyu AI Search introduces a novel approach for fine-grained, precise built-in citation and innovates in result presentation by integrating timeline visualization and textual-visual choreography. Evaluated on recent real-world queries, Xinyu AI Search outperforms eight existing technologies in human assessments, excelling in relevance, comprehensiveness, and insightfulness. Ablation studies validate the necessity of its key sub-modules.

    <h3>Towards Safety Reasoning in LLMs: AI-agentic Deliberation for   Policy-embedded CoT Data Creation</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal accuracy. AIDSAFE-generated CoT datasets can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmazonScience/AIDSAFE</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this paper, we introduce Online Multimodal Conversational Response Generation (OMCRG), a novel task that aims to online generate synchronized verbal and non-verbal listener feedback, conditioned on the speaker's multimodal input. OMCRG reflects natural dyadic interactions and poses new challenges in achieving synchronization between the generated audio and facial responses of the listener. To address these challenges, we innovatively introduce text as an intermediate modality to bridge the audio and facial responses. We hence propose OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that autoregressively generates high-quality multi-modal listener responses. OmniResponse leverages a pretrained LLM enhanced with two novel components: Chrono-Text, which temporally anchors generated text tokens, and TempoVoice, a controllable online TTS module that produces speech synchronized with facial reactions. To support further OMCRG research, we present ResponseNet, a new dataset comprising 696 high-quality dyadic interactions featuring synchronized split-screen videos, multichannel audio, transcripts, and facial behavior annotations. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on ResponseNet demonstrate that OmniResponse significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of semantic speech content, audio-visual synchronization, and generation quality.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning. Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advances in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain bottlenecked by two core challenges: architectural inefficiency due to reliance on Transformers, and a lack of structured fine-tuning for high-difficulty domains. We introduce \ourmodel, an attention-free language model that addresses both issues through architectural and data-centric innovations. Built on the state space dual (SSD) layers of Mamba-2, our model eliminates the need for self-attention and key-value caching, enabling fixed-memory, constant-time inference. To train it for complex reasoning, we propose a two-phase curriculum fine-tuning strategy based on the \textsc{PromptCoT} synthesis paradigm, which generates pedagogically structured problems via abstract concept selection and rationale-guided generation. On benchmark evaluations, \ourmodel-7B outperforms strong Transformer and hybrid models of comparable scale, and even surpasses the much larger Gemma3-27B by 2.6\% on AIME 24, 0.6\% on AIME 25, and 3.0\% on Livecodebench. These results highlight the potential of state space models as efficient and scalable alternatives to attention-based architectures for high-capacity reasoning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios. The source code will be published on https://github.com/agentdns.</div>

    <h3>Rethinking the Unsolvable: When In-Context Search Meets Test-Time   Scaling</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when trained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant challenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature relies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for evaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs' deliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance ceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of in-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find that by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with internal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on tasks previously deemed "unsolvable" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%). We provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this combination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on controlled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to previously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically, we show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling, significantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs on complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically underestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that fully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a better understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world deployments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.</div>

    <h3>Speculative Decoding Meets Quantization: Compatibility Evaluation and   Hierarchical Framework Design</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Speculative decoding and quantization effectively accelerate memory-bound inference of large language models. Speculative decoding mitigates the memory bandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass, which increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization by compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces computations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their strengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques. Surprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method EAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit weight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative decoding. Specifically, verifying a tree-style draft incurs significantly more time overhead than a single-token forward pass on 4-bit weight quantized models. This finding led to our new speculative decoding design: a hierarchical framework that employs a small model as an intermediate stage to turn tree-style drafts into sequence drafts, leveraging the memory access benefits of the target quantized model. Experimental results show that our hierarchical approach achieves a 2.78$\times$ speedup across various tasks for the 4-bit weight Llama-3-70B model on an A100 GPU, outperforming EAGLE-2 by 1.31$\times$.

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have popularized Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT), a strategy that encourages deliberate and step-by-step reasoning before producing a final answer. While LCoTs have enabled expert-level performance in complex tasks, how the internal structures of their reasoning chains drive, or even predict, the correctness of final answers remains a critical yet underexplored question. In this work, we present LCoT2Tree, an automated framework that converts sequential LCoTs into hierarchical tree structures and thus enables deeper structural analysis of LLM reasoning. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we reveal that structural patterns extracted by LCoT2Tree, including exploration, backtracking, and verification, serve as stronger predictors of final performance across a wide range of tasks and models. Leveraging an explainability technique, we further identify critical thought patterns such as over-branching that account for failures. Beyond diagnostic insights, the structural patterns by LCoT2Tree support practical applications, including improving Best-of-N decoding effectiveness. Overall, our results underscore the critical role of internal structures of reasoning chains, positioning LCoT2Tree as a powerful tool for diagnosing, interpreting, and improving reasoning in LLMs.</div>
