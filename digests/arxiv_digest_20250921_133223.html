        <h3>ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights</h3>
        Hey boss, I stumbled upon 5 fascinating papers today that I think you'll really dig:

<ol>
<li>There's a new study from some researchers that highlights security flaws in LLM-based agentic systems, specifically around Tool Invocation Prompts (TIP). They found that popular models like Cursor and Claude Code are vulnerable to serious attacks, and they proposed some solid defense mechanisms. This is crucial for anyone relying on these systems for secure operations!</li>

<li>A team introduced a cool framework called Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA) to improve language model consistency. It trains models to leverage peer insights from multi-agent debates, leading to better reasoning and decision-making. This could really enhance how we develop AI that needs to make consistent judgments.</li>

<li>Another interesting one is about a new evaluation pipeline called CLEAR, which assesses LLMs' text rewriting capabilities, especially for argumentative texts. By analyzing linguistic improvements across four levels, this could help refine models for better persuasion and coherenceâ€”super useful for content generation tools!</li>

<li>There's also a paper on a framework named KAMAC that improves medical decision-making by allowing LLM agents to dynamically form expert teams based on the context of a diagnosis. This could revolutionize how we handle complex clinical scenarios, making AI a better collaborator in healthcare.</li>

<li>Lastly, a review on Modular Machine Learning presents a new paradigm to tackle the limitations of current LLMs. It suggests breaking down models into modular components for better explainability and adaptability. This could be a game-changer for the future of AI development, making systems more robust and trustworthy.</li>

    <div class="abstract">LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating contradictory responses to identical prompts. While inference-time methods can mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes under exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K), single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4% Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA). These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3% on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While LLMs have been extensively studied on general text generation tasks, there is less research on text rewriting, a task related to general text generation, and particularly on the behavior of models on this task. In this paper we analyze what changes LLMs make in a text rewriting setting. We focus specifically on argumentative texts and their improvement, a task named Argument Improvement (ArgImp). We present CLEAR: an evaluation pipeline consisting of 57 metrics mapped to four linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. This pipeline is used to examine the qualities of LLM-rewritten arguments on a broad set of argumentation corpora and compare the behavior of different LLMs on this task and analyze the behavior of different LLMs on this task in terms of linguistic levels. By taking all four linguistic levels into consideration, we find that the models perform ArgImp by shortening the texts while simultaneously increasing average word length and merging sentences. Overall we note an increase in the persuasion and coherence dimensions.</div>

    <h3>A Knowledge-driven Adaptive Collaboration of LLMs for Enhancing Medical   Decision-making</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams. Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations, we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty expertise. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/KAMAC.</div>

    <h3>Modular Machine Learning: An Indispensable Path towards New-Generation   Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine learning research, including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in explainability, reliability, adaptability, and extensibility. In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</div>

    <h3>3DS: Medical Domain Adaptation of LLMs via Decomposed Difficulty-based   Data Selection</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models(LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle in specialized domains like healthcare due to limited domain-specific knowledge.Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT) data construction for domain adaptation often relies on heuristic methods, such as GPT-4 annotation or manual data selection, with a data-centric focus on presumed diverse, high-quality datasets. However, these methods overlook the model's inherent knowledge distribution, introducing noise, redundancy, and irrelevant data, leading to a mismatch between the selected data and the model's learning task, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage model-centric data selection framework, Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection (3DS), which aligns data with the model's knowledge distribution for optimized adaptation. In Stage1, we apply Prompt-Driven Data Selection via Explicit Alignment, where the the model filters irrelevant or redundant data based on its internal knowledge. In Stage2, we perform Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection, where data selection is guided by our defined difficulty decomposition, using three metrics: Instruction Understanding, Response Confidence, and Response Correctness. Additionally, an attention-based importance weighting mechanism captures token importance for more accurate difficulty calibration. This two-stage approach ensures the selected data is not only aligned with the model's knowledge and preferences but also appropriately challenging for the model to learn, leading to more effective and targeted domain adaptation. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3DS over exisiting methods in accuracy by over 5.29%.

    <h3>FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Humanitarian Mine Action has generated extensive best-practice knowledge, but much remains locked in unstructured reports. We introduce TextMine, an ontology-guided pipeline that uses Large Language Models to extract knowledge triples from HMA texts. TextMine integrates document chunking, domain-aware prompting, triple extraction, and both reference-based and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. We also create the first HMA ontology and a curated dataset of real-world demining reports. Experiments show ontology-aligned prompts boost extraction accuracy by 44.2%, cut hallucinations by 22.5%, and improve format conformance by 20.9% over baselines. While validated on Cambodian reports, TextMine can adapt to global demining efforts or other domains, transforming unstructured data into structured knowledge.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid progress of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred the creation of numerous benchmarks. However, conventional full-coverage Question-Answering evaluations suffer from high redundancy and low efficiency. Inspired by human interview processes, we propose a multi-to-one interview paradigm for efficient MLLM evaluation. Our framework consists of (i) a two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases, (ii) dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and (iii) an adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level chosen. Experiments on different benchmarks show that the proposed paradigm achieves significantly higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the number of required questions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed paradigm provides a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM benchmarking.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure. Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses, Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which play a crucial role in supporting cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have utilized large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges, lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational settings.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues, exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A, a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities.

    <div class="abstract">With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating complex, multi-agent workflows, organizations face mounting risks from errors, emergent behaviors, and systemic failures that current evaluation methods fail to capture. We present AgentCompass, the first evaluation framework designed specifically for post-deployment monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows. AgentCompass models the reasoning process of expert debuggers through a structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic summarization. The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory system-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions. Through collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's practical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy against the publicly available TRAIL benchmark. AgentCompass achieves state-of-the-art results on key metrics, while uncovering critical issues missed in human annotations, underscoring its role as a robust, developer-centric tool for reliable monitoring and improvement of agentic systems in production.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents. Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior, both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e., practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept reserved for large corporations to a present-day, accessible, and essential growth lever for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). For entrepreneurs and business leaders, strategic AI adoption is no longer an option but an imperative for competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term survival. This report provides a comprehensive framework for SME leaders to navigate this technological shift, offering the foundational knowledge, business case, practical applications, and strategic guidance necessary to harness the power of AI. The quantitative evidence supporting AI adoption is compelling; 91% of SMEs using AI report that it directly boosts their revenue. Beyond top-line growth, AI drives profound operational efficiencies, with studies showing it can reduce operational costs by up to 30% and save businesses more than 20 hours of valuable time each month.

    <div class="abstract">Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Word2VecT/Middo</div>

    <h3>A.S.E: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Security in   AI-Generated Code</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI-assisted programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Moreover, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation and help developers identify the most suitable models for practical tasks. They also lay the groundwork for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</div>

    <h3>DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series   Forecasting Framework</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</div>

    <h3>Read Before You Think: Mitigating LLM Comprehension Failures with   Step-by-Step Reading</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on complex reasoning tasks due to flawed question comprehension, not just flawed logic. This paper presents a systematic investigation into these comprehension failures. Our work yields three key insights: (1) the step-by-step principle, effective for calculation, can be migrated to the reading process to enhance comprehension; (2) increasing the proportion of question-related tokens (e.g., via repetition) succeeds by refocusing attention, a mechanism that can be explicitly controlled; and (3) backward dependencies represent a core bottleneck for decoder-only models that persists even with strong methods like Chain-of-Thought. Based on these findings, we introduce the Step-by-Step Reading (SSR) family of prompts. This multi-stage approach culminates in SSR++, a method specifically engineered to deepen model comprehension by guiding it to parse questions with finer granularity, focus attention on critical tokens, and resolve backward dependencies through iterative re-contextualization. SSR++ sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple reasoning benchmarks, and our analysis confirms it works by directly mitigating semantic misunderstanding. These results demonstrate that guiding how a model reads is a powerful and efficient method for improving its reasoning ability.</div>
