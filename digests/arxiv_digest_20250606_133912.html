    <h3>TracLLM: A Generic Framework for Attributing Long Context LLMs</h3>
    <div class="scores">

    <div class="abstract">Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM. Our code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.</div>

    <h3>VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code   Generation</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 9/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</div>

    <h3>AhaKV: Adaptive Holistic Attention-Driven KV Cache Eviction for   Efficient Inference of Large Language Models</h3>
    <div class="scores">

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 10/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the (Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores. To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism, AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.</div>

    <h3>Micro-Act: Mitigate Knowledge Conflict in Question Answering via   Actionable Self-Reasoning</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 9/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent, parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.</div>

    <h3>Safe: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via   Retrospective Step-aware Formal Verification</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose $FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$ formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.</div>

    <h3>High Accuracy, Less Talk (HALT): Reliable LLMs through   Capability-Aligned Finetuning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The application of AI in psychiatric diagnosis faces significant challenges, including the subjective nature of mental health assessments, symptom overlap across disorders, and privacy constraints limiting data availability. To address these issues, we present MoodAngels, the first specialized multi-agent framework for mood disorder diagnosis. Our approach combines granular-scale analysis of clinical assessments with a structured verification process, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex psychiatric data. Complementing this framework, we introduce MoodSyn, an open-source dataset of 1,173 synthetic psychiatric cases that preserves clinical validity while ensuring patient privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that MoodAngels outperforms conventional methods, with our baseline agent achieving 12.3% higher accuracy than GPT-4o on real-world cases, and our full multi-agent system delivering further improvements. Evaluation in the MoodSyn dataset demonstrates exceptional fidelity, accurately reproducing both the core statistical patterns and complex relationships present in the original data while maintaining strong utility for machine learning applications. Together, these contributions provide both an advanced diagnostic tool and a critical research resource for computational psychiatry, bridging important gaps in AI-assisted mental health assessment.</div>

    <h3>Improving Data Efficiency for LLM Reinforcement Fine-tuning Through   Difficulty-targeted Online Data Selection and Rollout Replay</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or \textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging university-level algorithms exams. By testing multiple models on both a Romanian exam and its high-quality English translation, we analyze LLMs' problem-solving capabilities, consistency, and multilingual performance. Our empirical study reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student feedback. The insights and best practices discussed herein pave the way for further integration of generative AI in advanced algorithm education.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore 352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice, and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual, LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text, struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty. Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths, despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge work.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation, demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing computational costs by over 43%.

    <div class="abstract">The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges. The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods, effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation. Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing, perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.</div>

    <h3>Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked   Preferences</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.</div>

    <h3>Efficient Knowledge Editing via Minimal Precomputation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a "precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.</div>
