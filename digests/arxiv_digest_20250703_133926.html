    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning designed specifically for users with limited computational resources, particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems. cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs), transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring power budgets.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model (henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset (syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy (for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.</div>

    <h3>Data Agent: A Holistic Architecture for Orchestrating Data+AI Ecosystems</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning. Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.   To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning, and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools, orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent, data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges associated with designing data agent systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers (micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an 18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed. Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business analysis.</div>

    <h3>Impact of Fine-Tuning Methods on Memorization in Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However, the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore, prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more privacy-preserving option.</div>

    <h3>How Well Does GPT-4o Understand Vision? Evaluating Multimodal Foundation   Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc).   The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.   We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</div>

    <h3>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with   Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Domain specific chatbot applications often involve multi step interactions, such as refining search filters, selecting multiple items, or performing comparisons. Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) handle these workflows by providing explicit "Submit" (commit data) and "Reset" (discard data) actions, allowing back-end systems to track user intent unambiguously. In contrast, conversational agents rely on subtle language cues, which can lead to confusion and incomplete context management. This paper proposes modeling these GUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching (reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts. By capturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT) reasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user confusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic. We demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios, highlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and efficiency.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward \textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and \textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately $1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking. Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial implementation.</div>

Fine-tuning LLMs with parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining. Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings, processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive, reason, and act within dynamic environments. With the rapid advancements in generative AI (GenAI), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved AI agents' capabilities in semantic comprehension, complex reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. At the same time, the rise of Agentic AI highlights adaptability and goal-directed autonomy in dynamic and complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents (MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous decision-making, opening new avenues for smart manufacturing. However, the definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential challenges they may face.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness, attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models, contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content. However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios with noisy or conflicting evidence.</div>

    <h3>Rethinking the Illusion of Thinking</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots. Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100 agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding. We open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities.
