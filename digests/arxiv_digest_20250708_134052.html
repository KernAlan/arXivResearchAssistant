    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog), and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies. In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types, contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.</div>

    <h3>MARBLE: A Multi-Agent Rule-Based LLM Reasoning Engine for Accident   Severity Prediction</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation. Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes, supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics. Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below 48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data, domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high response quality and accuracy.</div>

    <h3>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning   of Reasoning Models?</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.</div>

While full automation remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and $F_1$ score.</div>

    <h3>Attention Slipping: A Mechanistic Understanding of Jailbreak Attacks and   Defenses in LLMs</h3>
    <div class="scores">

    <div class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat. However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks: Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning. Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening, a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2) show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.</div>

    <h3>A Comparative Study of Specialized LLMs as Dense Retrievers</h3>

    <div class="abstract">While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.</div>

    <h3>Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 8/10</span>

    <div class="abstract">Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</div>

    <h3>Train-before-Test Harmonizes Language Model Rankings</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 8/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released, different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24 benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family, train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-machine interaction since ChatGPT's 2022 debut, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion.   We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs) for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for traffic incident impact prediction.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges, methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire advancement in next-generation network security systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI. Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future urban environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.</div>

Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect in modern LLM development.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their ability to forecast future events remains understudied. A year ago, large language models struggle to come close to the accuracy of a human crowd. I evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on 464 forecasting questions from Metaculus, comparing their performance against human superforecasters. Frontier models achieve Brier scores that ostensibly surpass the human crowd but still significantly underperform a group of superforecasters.</div>

    <h3>A validity-guided workflow for robust large language model research in   psychology</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability: Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.</div>

    <h3>Source Attribution in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning, their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3) evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents, especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy, complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG explainability.</div>

    <h3>LayerCake: Token-Aware Contrastive Decoding within Large Language Model   Layers</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally, it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms, and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions, including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and scalability.</div>
