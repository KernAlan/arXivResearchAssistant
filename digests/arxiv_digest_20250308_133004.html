    <div class="abstract">Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires localized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical reasoning capabilities. Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge. Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query. KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the location of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate easier training due to their more prominent identity path, they often yield suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a straightforward yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. This design not only stabilizes training but also enhances performance, particularly in the context of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments in both dense and sparse architectures show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models. %Code will be made publicly available.

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning but remain constrained by their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach, which struggles with complex tasks requiring more nuanced topological reasoning. We introduce SOLAR, Scalable Optimization of Large-scale Architecture for Reasoning, a framework that dynamically optimizes various reasoning topologies to enhance accuracy and efficiency.   Our Topological Annotation Generation (TAG) system automates topological dataset creation and segmentation, improving post-training and evaluation. Additionally, we propose Topological-Scaling, a reward-driven framework that aligns training and inference scaling, equipping LLMs with adaptive, task-aware reasoning.   SOLAR achieves substantial gains on MATH and GSM8K: +5% accuracy with Topological Tuning, +9% with Topological Reward, and +10.02% with Hybrid Scaling. It also reduces response length by over 5% for complex problems, lowering inference latency.   To foster the reward system, we train a multi-task Topological Reward Model (M-TRM), which autonomously selects the best reasoning topology and answer in a single pass, eliminating the need for training and inference on multiple single-task TRMs (S-TRMs), thus reducing both training cost and inference latency. In addition, in terms of performance, M-TRM surpasses all S-TRMs, improving accuracy by +10% and rank correlation by +9%.   To the best of our knowledge, SOLAR sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-precision LLM reasoning while introducing an automated annotation process and a dynamic reasoning topology competition mechanism.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid evolution of malware attacks calls for the development of innovative detection methods, especially in resource-constrained edge computing. Traditional detection techniques struggle to keep up with modern malware's sophistication and adaptability, prompting a shift towards advanced methodologies like those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced malware detection. However, deploying LLMs for malware detection directly at edge devices raises several challenges, including ensuring accuracy in constrained environments and addressing edge devices' energy and computational limits. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an architecture leveraging lightweight LLMs' strengths while addressing limitations like reduced accuracy and insufficient computational power. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight LLM-based approach for edge computing, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation using several state-of-the-art lightweight LLMs. We test them with several publicly available datasets specifically designed for edge and IoT scenarios and different edge nodes with varying computational power and characteristics.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative visual analytics systems has transformed data-driven insights, yet significant challenges persist in accurately interpreting users' analytical and interaction intents. While language inputs offer flexibility, they often lack precision, making the expression of complex intents inefficient, error-prone, and time-intensive. To address these limitations, we investigate the design space of multimodal interactions for generative visual analytics through a literature review and pilot brainstorming sessions. Building on these insights, we introduce a highly extensible workflow that integrates multiple LLM agents for intent inference and visualization generation. We develop InterChat, a generative visual analytics system that combines direct manipulation of visual elements with natural language inputs. This integration enables precise intent communication and supports progressive, visually driven exploratory data analyses. By employing effective prompt engineering, and contextual interaction linking, alongside intuitive visualization and interaction designs, InterChat bridges the gap between user interactions and LLM-driven visualizations, enhancing both interpretability and usability. Extensive evaluations, including two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert feedback, demonstrate the effectiveness of InterChat. Results show significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of handling complex visual analytics tasks, highlighting the potential of multimodal interactions to redefine user engagement and analytical depth in generative visual analytics.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4), reviving the research of general autonomous agents with human-like cognitive abilities. Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs. Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant method for controlling language model outputs, it suffers from high computational costs and training instability. Guided decoding, especially value-guided methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by controlling outputs without re-training models. However, the accuracy of the value function is crucial for value-guided decoding, as inaccuracies can lead to suboptimal decision-making and degraded performance. Existing methods struggle with accurately estimating the optimal value function, leading to less effective control. We propose Iterative Value Function Optimization, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: Monte Carlo Value Estimation, which reduces estimation variance by exploring diverse trajectories, and Iterative On-Policy Optimization, which progressively improves value estimation through collecting trajectories from value-guided policies. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-turn dialogue, and instruction following demonstrate the effectiveness of value-guided decoding approaches in aligning language models. These approaches not only achieve alignment but also significantly reduce computational costs by leveraging principled value function optimization for efficient and effective control.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reasoning language models have shown an uncanny ability to improve performance at test-time by ``thinking longer''-that is, by generating longer chain-of-thought sequences and hence using more compute. However, the length of their chain-of-thought reasoning is not controllable, making it impossible to allocate test-time compute to achieve a desired level of performance. We introduce Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints. We use LCPO to train L1, a reasoning language model that produces outputs satisfying a length constraint given in its prompt. L1's length control allows for smoothly trading off computational cost and accuracy on a wide range of tasks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art S1 method for length control. Furthermore, we uncover an unexpected short chain-of-thought capability in models trained with LCPO. For instance, our 1.5B L1 model surpasses GPT-4o at equal reasoning lengths. Overall, LCPO enables precise control over reasoning length, allowing for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy.

    <div class="abstract">Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning such as DeepSeek, we for the first time identify a key dilemma in reasoning robustness and generalization: significant performance degradation on novel or incomplete data, suggesting a reliance on memorized patterns rather than systematic reasoning. Our closer examination reveals four key unique limitations underlying this issue:(1) Positional bias--models favor earlier queries in multi-query inputs but answering the wrong one in the latter (e.g., GPT-4o's accuracy drops from 75.8 percent to 72.8 percent); (2) Instruction sensitivity--performance declines by 5.0 to 7.5 percent in the Qwen2.5 Series and by 5.0 percent in DeepSeek-V3 with auxiliary guidance; (3) Numerical fragility--value substitution sharply reduces accuracy (e.g., GPT-4o drops from 97.5 percent to 82.5 percent, GPT-o1-mini drops from 97.5 percent to 92.5 percent); and (4) Memory dependence--models resort to guesswork when missing critical data. These findings further highlight the reliance on heuristic recall over rigorous logical inference, demonstrating challenges in reasoning robustness. To comprehensively investigate these robustness challenges, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed as Math-RoB, that exploits hallucinations triggered by missing information to expose reasoning gaps. This is achieved by an instruction-based approach to generate diverse datasets that closely resemble training distributions, facilitating a holistic robustness assessment and advancing the development of more robust reasoning frameworks.

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose $\textit{Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS)}$, a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model based multi-agent systems are revolutionizing autonomous communication and collaboration, yet they remain vulnerable to security threats like unauthorized access and data breaches. To address this, we introduce AgentSafe, a novel framework that enhances MAS security through hierarchical information management and memory protection. AgentSafe classifies information by security levels, restricting sensitive data access to authorized agents. AgentSafe incorporates two components: ThreatSieve, which secures communication by verifying information authority and preventing impersonation, and HierarCache, an adaptive memory management system that defends against unauthorized access and malicious poisoning, representing the first systematic defense for agent memory. Experiments across various LLMs show that AgentSafe significantly boosts system resilience, achieving defense success rates above 80% under adversarial conditions. Additionally, AgentSafe demonstrates scalability, maintaining robust performance as agent numbers and information complexity grow. Results underscore effectiveness of AgentSafe in securing MAS and its potential for real-world application.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We propose DRAGO, a novel approach for continual model-based reinforcement learning aimed at improving the incremental development of world models across a sequence of tasks that differ in their reward functions but not the state space or dynamics. DRAGO comprises two key components: Synthetic Experience Rehearsal, which leverages generative models to create synthetic experiences from past tasks, allowing the agent to reinforce previously learned dynamics without storing data, and Regaining Memories Through Exploration, which introduces an intrinsic reward mechanism to guide the agent toward revisiting relevant states from prior tasks. Together, these components enable the agent to maintain a comprehensive and continually developing world model, facilitating more effective learning and adaptation across diverse environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DRAGO is able to preserve knowledge across tasks, achieving superior performance in various continual learning scenarios.</div>

    <h3>Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning for Sequential   Recommendation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Sequential recommendation aims to model user preferences based on historical behavior sequences, which is crucial for various online platforms. Data sparsity remains a significant challenge in this area as most users have limited interactions and many items receive little attention. To mitigate this issue, contrastive learning has been widely adopted. By constructing positive sample pairs from the data itself and maximizing their agreement in the embedding space,it can leverage available data more effectively. Constructing reasonable positive sample pairs is crucial for the success of contrastive learning. However, current approaches struggle to generate reliable positive pairs as they either rely on representations learned from inherently sparse collaborative signals or use random perturbations which introduce significant uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL), which leverages semantic information to improve the reliability of contrastive samples. SRA-CL comprises two main components: (1) Cross-Sequence Contrastive Learning via User Semantic Retrieval, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to understand diverse user preferences and retrieve semantically similar users to form reliable positive samples through a learnable sample synthesis method; and (2) Intra-Sequence Contrastive Learning via Item Semantic Retrieval, which employs LLMs to comprehend items and retrieve similar items to perform semantic-based item substitution, thereby creating semantically consistent augmented views for contrastive learning. SRA-CL is plug-and-play and can be integrated into standard sequential recommendation models. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various clinical applications has attracted growing research attention. However, real-world clinical decision-making differs significantly from the standardized, exam-style scenarios commonly used in current efforts. In this paper, we present the RiskAgent system to perform a broad range of medical risk predictions, covering over 387 risk scenarios across diverse complex diseases, e.g., cardiovascular disease and cancer. RiskAgent is designed to collaborate with hundreds of clinical decision tools, i.e., risk calculators and scoring systems that are supported by evidence-based medicine. To evaluate our method, we have built the first benchmark MedRisk specialized for risk prediction, including 12,352 questions spanning 154 diseases, 86 symptoms, 50 specialties, and 24 organ systems. The results show that our RiskAgent, with 8 billion model parameters, achieves 76.33% accuracy, outperforming the most recent commercial LLMs, o1, o3-mini, and GPT-4.5, and doubling the 38.39% accuracy of GPT-4o. On rare diseases, e.g., Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), RiskAgent outperforms o1 and GPT-4.5 by 27.27% and 45.46% accuracy, respectively. Finally, we further conduct a generalization evaluation on an external evidence-based diagnosis benchmark and show that our RiskAgent achieves the best results. These encouraging results demonstrate the great potential of our solution for diverse diagnosis domains. To improve the adaptability of our model in different scenarios, we have built and open-sourced a family of models ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our code, data, and models are all available at https://github.com/AI-in-Health/RiskAgent.</div>

    <h3>Attentive Reasoning Queries: A Systematic Method for Optimizing   Instruction-Following in Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">We present Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), a novel structured reasoning approach that significantly improves instruction-following in Large Language Models through domain-specialized reasoning blueprints. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain adherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn conversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs address this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with targeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate intermediate reasoning throughout the completion process. In extensive testing within Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs were born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test scenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct response generation (81.5%). ARQs showed particular strength in addressing persistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination prevention. Our analysis also revealed that ARQs can potentially be more computationally efficient than free-form reasoning when carefully designed. These findings demonstrate that structured reasoning approaches provide effective mechanisms for controlling how LLMs process information and make decisions in complex scenarios.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Large Language Model(LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex decision-making tasks. However, existing frameworks inevitably rely on serialized execution paradigms, where agents must complete sequential LLM planning before taking action. This fundamental constraint severely limits real-time responsiveness and adaptation, which is crucial in dynamic environments with ever-changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel parallelized planning-acting framework for LLM-based MAS, featuring a dual-thread architecture with interruptible execution to enable concurrent planning and acting. Specifically, our framework comprises two core threads:(1) a planning thread driven by a centralized memory system, maintaining synchronization of environmental states and agent communication to support dynamic decision-making; and (2) an acting thread equipped with a comprehensive skill library, enabling automated task execution through recursive decomposition. Extensive experiments on challenging Minecraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</div>
