    <div class="abstract">Optimization plays a vital role in scientific research and practical applications, but formulating a concrete optimization problem described in natural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to solve the problem requires substantial domain expertise. We introduce \textbf{OptimAI}, a framework for solving \underline{Optim}ization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered \underline{AI} agents, achieving superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is built upon four key roles: (1) a \emph{formulator} that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a \emph{planner} that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a \emph{coder} and a \emph{code critic} capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions. Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain. Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, allowing us to conveniently explore the synergistic effect of combining diverse models within a unified system. Our approach attains 88.1\% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 71.2\% on the Optibench (non-linear w/o table) subset, reducing error rates by 58\% and 50\% respectively over prior best results.</div>

    <h3>How Effective are Generative Large Language Models in Performing   Requirements Classification?</h3>

    <div class="abstract">In recent years, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing (NLP), with generative models opening new possibilities for tasks that require context-aware text generation. Requirements engineering (RE) has also seen a surge in the experimentation of LLMs for different tasks, including trace-link detection, regulatory compliance, and others. Requirements classification is a common task in RE. While non-generative LLMs like BERT have been successfully applied to this task, there has been limited exploration of generative LLMs. This gap raises an important question: how well can generative LLMs, which produce context-aware outputs, perform in requirements classification? In this study, we explore the effectiveness of three generative LLMs-Bloom, Gemma, and Llama-in performing both binary and multi-class requirements classification. We design an extensive experimental study involving over 400 experiments across three widely used datasets (PROMISE NFR, Functional-Quality, and SecReq). Our study concludes that while factors like prompt design and LLM architecture are universally important, others-such as dataset variations-have a more situational impact, depending on the complexity of the classification task. This insight can guide future model development and deployment strategies, focusing on optimising prompt structures and aligning model architectures with task-specific needs for improved performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of information that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical text generation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in various agentic applications. A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making.</div>

    <h3>Impact of Noise on LLM-Models Performance in Abstraction and Reasoning   Corpus (ARC) Tasks with Model Temperature Considerations</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated growing interest in their structured reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving abstraction and pattern recognition. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by testing how well AI models generalize to novel problems. While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise conditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any, suggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern matching. To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across different noise levels and temperature settings. Our results reveal that the introduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of architecture. This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs, despite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input perturbations. Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world applicability, where noise and uncertainty are common. By comparing how different model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights into the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks. This work underscores the need for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of handling the ambiguity and variability inherent in real-world scenarios. Our findings aim to guide future research toward enhancing model generalization, robustness, and alignment with human-like cognitive flexibility.</div>

    <h3>WALL-E 2.0: World Alignment by NeuroSymbolic Learning improves World   Model-based LLM Agents</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Can we build accurate world models out of large language models (LLMs)? How can world models benefit LLM agents? The gap between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics usually bottlenecks LLMs' performance as world models. To bridge the gap, we propose a training-free "world alignment" that learns an environment's symbolic knowledge complementary to LLMs. The symbolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which are extracted by LLMs from exploration trajectories and encoded into executable codes to regulate LLM agents' policies. We further propose an RL-free, model-based agent "WALL-E 2.0" through the model-predictive control (MPC) framework. Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on the fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future steps' actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model. While the LLM agent's strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of its planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned world model. They together considerably improve learning efficiency in a new environment. On open-world challenges in Mars (Minecraft like) and ALFWorld (embodied indoor environments), WALL-E 2.0 significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., surpassing baselines in Mars by 16.1%-51.6% of success rate and by at least 61.7% in score. In ALFWorld, it achieves a new record 98% success rate after only 4 iterations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we demonstrate that distinctive keys during LLM inference tend to have high attention scores. We explore this phenomenon and propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based on key similarity. This method facilitates the deployment of LLM-based application requiring long input prompts in resource-constrained environments with limited memory and compute budgets. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We demonstrate that KeyDiff computes the optimal solution to a KV cache selection problem that maximizes key diversity, providing a theoretical understanding of KeyDiff. Notably,KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff across diverse tasks and models, illustrating a performance gap of less than 0.04\% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$ 23\% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on the LongBench benchmark for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) struggle with maintaining coherence in extended conversations spanning hundreds of turns, despite performing well within their context windows. This paper introduces HEMA (Hippocampus-Inspired Extended Memory Architecture), a dual-memory system inspired by human cognitive processes. HEMA combines Compact Memory - a continuously updated one-sentence summary preserving global narrative coherence, and Vector Memory - an episodic store of chunk embeddings queried via cosine similarity. When integrated with a 6B-parameter transformer, HEMA maintains coherent dialogues beyond 300 turns while keeping prompt length under 3,500 tokens. Experimental results show substantial improvements: factual recall accuracy increases from 41% to 87%, and human-rated coherence improves from 2.7 to 4.3 on a 5-point scale. With 10K indexed chunks, Vector Memory achieves P@5 >= 0.80 and R@50 >= 0.74, doubling the area under the precision-recall curve compared to summarization-only approaches. Ablation studies reveal two key insights: semantic forgetting through age-weighted pruning reduces retrieval latency by 34% with minimal recall loss, and a two-level summary hierarchy prevents cascade errors in ultra-long conversations exceeding 1,000 turns. HEMA demonstrates that combining verbatim recall with semantic continuity provides a practical solution for privacy-aware conversational AI capable of month-long dialogues without model retraining.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of existing communication protocols for LLM agents. We classify them into four main categories and make an analysis to help users and developers select the most suitable protocols for specific applications. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore future challenges, such as how protocols can adapt and survive in fast-evolving environments, and what qualities future protocols might need to support the next generation of LLM agent ecosystems. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and analyzing code for security vulnerabilities, such as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure and substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing sensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs. This work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable alternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection. We investigated whether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be effectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within Python code. To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500 examples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data generation coupled with meticulous human review. Initial tests confirmed that the base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples. However, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM achieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99% accuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score. These results strongly suggest that fine-tuned SLMs can serve as highly accurate and efficient tools for CWE detection, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for integrating advanced security analysis directly into development workflows.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite decades of research and practice in automated software testing, several fundamental concepts remain ill-defined and under-explored, yet offer enormous potential real-world impact. We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching `Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated `just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

    <div class="abstract">Medical consultation dialogues contain critical clinical information, yet their unstructured nature hinders effective utilization in diagnosis and treatment. Traditional methods, relying on rule-based or shallow machine learning techniques, struggle to capture deep and implicit semantics. Recently, large pre-trained language models and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a lightweight fine-tuning method, have shown promise for structured information extraction. We propose EMRModel, a novel approach that integrates LoRA-based fine-tuning with code-style prompt design, aiming to efficiently convert medical consultation dialogues into structured electronic medical records (EMRs). Additionally, we construct a high-quality, realistically grounded dataset of medical consultation dialogues with detailed annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation benchmark for medical consultation information extraction and provide a systematic evaluation methodology, advancing the optimization of medical natural language processing (NLP) models. Experimental results show EMRModel achieves an F1 score of 88.1%, improving by49.5% over standard pre-trained models. Compared to traditional LoRA fine-tuning methods, our model shows superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in structured medical record extraction tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances. Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field. The datasets and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In many real-world machine learning (ML) applications (e.g. detecting broken bones in x-ray images, detecting species in camera traps), in practice models need to perform well on specific deployments (e.g. a specific hospital, a specific national park) rather than the domain broadly. However, deployments often have imbalanced, unique data distributions. Discrepancy between the training distribution and the deployment distribution can lead to suboptimal performance, highlighting the need to select deployment-specialized subsets from the available training data. We formalize dataset subset selection for specialization (DS3): given a training set drawn from a general distribution and a (potentially unlabeled) query set drawn from the desired deployment-specific distribution, the goal is to select a subset of the training data that optimizes deployment performance.   We introduce DataS^3; the first dataset and benchmark designed specifically for the DS3 problem. DataS^3 encompasses diverse real-world application domains, each with a set of distinct deployments to specialize in. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating algorithms from various families--including coresets, data filtering, and data curation--on DataS^3, and find that general-distribution methods consistently fail on deployment-specific tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of manually curated (deployment-specific) expert subsets that outperform training on all available data with accuracy gains up to 51.3 percent. Our benchmark highlights the critical role of tailored dataset curation in enhancing performance and training efficiency on deployment-specific distributions, which we posit will only become more important as global, public datasets become available across domains and ML models are deployed in the real world.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical framework for ensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems serve society's needs while minimizing potential harms. As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. This article examines how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of real-world and emerging practices, the article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial bridge between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to fine-tune AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach aligns with broader "Responsibility by Design" principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid expansion of IoT ecosystems introduces severe challenges in scalability, security, and real-time decision-making. Traditional centralized architectures struggle with latency, privacy concerns, and excessive resource consumption, making them unsuitable for modern large-scale IoT deployments. This paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative IoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS), dynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By leveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances intelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments. Evaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model accuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency, outperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt). These findings highlight the potential of integrating LLM-powered federated learning into large-scale IoT ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, scalable, and adaptive IoT management solutions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Determining the most effective Large Language Model for code smell detection presents a complex challenge. This study introduces a structured methodology and evaluation matrix to tackle this issue, leveraging a curated dataset of code samples consistently annotated with known smells. The dataset spans four prominent programming languages Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++; allowing for cross language comparison. We benchmark two state of the art LLMs, OpenAI GPT 4.0 and DeepSeek-V3, using precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. Our analysis covers three levels of detail: overall performance, category level performance, and individual code smell type performance. Additionally, we explore cost effectiveness by comparing the token based detection approach of GPT 4.0 with the pattern-matching techniques employed by DeepSeek V3. The study also includes a cost analysis relative to traditional static analysis tools such as SonarQube. The findings offer valuable guidance for practitioners in selecting an efficient, cost effective solution for automated code smell detection</div>

    <h3>CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</div>

    <h3>Insights from Verification: Training a Verilog Generation LLM with   Reinforcement Learning with Testbench Feedback</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in Verilog generation from natural language description. However, ensuring the functional correctness of the generated code remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a method that integrates verification insights from testbench into the training of Verilog generation LLMs, aligning the training with the fundamental goal of hardware design: functional correctness. The main obstacle in using LLMs for Verilog code generation is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, particularly testbenches paired with design specifications and code. To address this problem, we introduce an automatic testbench generation pipeline that decomposes the process and uses feedback from the Verilog compiler simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness. We then use the testbench to evaluate the generated codes and collect them for further training, where verification insights are introduced. Our method applies reinforcement learning (RL), specifically direct preference optimization (DPO), to align Verilog code generation with functional correctness by training preference pairs based on testbench outcomes. In evaluations on VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating functionally correct Verilog code. We open source all training code, data, and models at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VeriPrefer-E88B.</div>

    <h3>Implementing Rational Choice Functions with LLMs and Measuring their   Alignment with User Preferences</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) become integral to intelligent user interfaces (IUIs), their role as decision-making agents raises critical concerns about alignment. Although extensive research has addressed issues such as factuality, bias, and toxicity, comparatively little attention has been paid to measuring alignment to preferences, i.e., the relative desirability of different alternatives, a concept used in decision making, economics, and social choice theory. However, a reliable decision-making agent makes choices that align well with user preferences.   In this paper, we generalize existing methods that exploit LLMs for ranking alternative outcomes by addressing alignment with the broader and more flexible concept of user preferences, which includes both strict preferences and indifference among alternatives. To this end, we put forward design principles for using LLMs to implement rational choice functions, and provide the necessary tools to measure preference satisfaction. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through an empirical study in a practical application of an IUI in the automotive domain.</div>
