    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of large language models has unlocked remarkable capabilities across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks. However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost, performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy. Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights into optimal strategies for model combination.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge: agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints, such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words. (3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50 agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to facilitate future research.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial role of dataset design in preserving model alignment.

    <div class="abstract">The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to remarkable achievements across numerous applications. However, their ability to generate harmful content has sparked substantial safety concerns. Despite the implementation of safety alignment techniques during the pre-training phase, recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs on adversarial or even benign data can inadvertently compromise their safety. In this paper, we re-examine the fundamental issue of why fine-tuning on non-harmful data still results in safety degradation. We introduce a safety-aware probing (SAP) optimization framework designed to mitigate the safety risks of fine-tuning LLMs. Specifically, SAP incorporates a safety-aware probe into the gradient propagation process, mitigating the model's risk of safety degradation by identifying potential pitfalls in gradient directions, thereby enhancing task-specific performance while successfully preserving model safety. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAP effectively reduces harmfulness below the original fine-tuned model and achieves comparable test loss to standard fine-tuning methods.

    <div class="abstract">While recent research increasingly emphasizes the value of human-LLM collaboration in competitive programming and proposes numerous empirical methods, a comprehensive understanding remains elusive due to the fragmented nature of existing studies and their use of diverse, application-specific human feedback. Thus, our work serves a three-fold purpose: First, we present the first taxonomy of human feedback consolidating the entire programming process, which promotes fine-grained evaluation. Second, we introduce ELABORATIONSET, a novel programming dataset specifically designed for human-LLM collaboration, meticulously annotated to enable large-scale simulated human feedback and facilitate costeffective real human interaction studies. Third, we introduce ELABORATION, a novel benchmark to facilitate a thorough assessment of human-LLM competitive programming. With ELABORATION, we pinpoint strengthes and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby setting the foundation for future improvement.

    <div class="abstract">The widespread adoption of Language Models (LMs) across industries is driving interest in deploying these services across the computing continuum, from the cloud to the network edge. This shift aims to reduce costs, lower latency, and improve reliability and privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs), enabled by advances in model compression, are central to this shift, offering a path to on-device inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. This work examines the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity. Rather than proposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we present platform-level comparisons and design insights for building efficient, adaptive LM inference systems across heterogeneous environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.   To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.   We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents, enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay, where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks. Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth. Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory components that support robust, long-term agent performance. We also release our code to facilitate further study.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly, or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++ outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient retrieval.

    <h3>X-MAS: Towards Building Multi-Agent Systems with Heterogeneous LLMs</h3>

    <div class="abstract">LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over 1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign. Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable 47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.</div>

    <h3>Fixing Data That Hurts Performance: Cascading LLMs to Relabel Hard   Negatives for Robust Information Retrieval</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of 15 datasets from the BGE collection reduces the training set size by 2.35$\times$ and increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We propose a simple, cost-effective approach using cascading LLM prompts to identify and relabel hard negatives. Experimental results show that relabeling false negatives with true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B retrieval models by 0.7-1.4 nDCG@10 on BEIR and by 1.7-1.8 nDCG@10 on zero-shot AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of the cascading design is further supported by human annotation results, where we find judgment by GPT-4o shows much higher agreement with humans than GPT-4o-mini.</div>

    <h3>Latent Principle Discovery for Language Model Self-Improvement</h3>

    <div class="abstract">When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations, it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering. Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated, principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

    <div class="abstract">Despite providing superior performance, open-source large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to abusive usage. To address this issue, recent works propose LLM fingerprinting methods to identify the specific source LLMs behind suspect applications. However, these methods fail to provide stealthy and robust fingerprint verification. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM fingerprinting scheme, namely CoTSRF, which utilizes the Chain of Thought (CoT) as the fingerprint of an LLM. CoTSRF first collects the responses from the source LLM by querying it with crafted CoT queries. Then, it applies contrastive learning to train a CoT extractor that extracts the CoT feature (i.e., fingerprint) from the responses. Finally, CoTSRF conducts fingerprint verification by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the CoT features of the source and suspect LLMs against an empirical threshold. Various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of our proposed CoTSRF for fingerprinting LLMs, particularly in stealthy and robust fingerprint verification.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by bypassing built-in safety mechanisms and leading to harmful outputs. Studying these attacks is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model security. This paper presents a systematic survey of jailbreak methods from the novel perspective of stealth. We find that existing attacks struggle to simultaneously achieve toxic stealth (concealing toxic content) and linguistic stealth (maintaining linguistic naturalness). Motivated by this, we propose StegoAttack, a fully stealthy jailbreak attack that uses steganography to hide the harmful query within benign, semantically coherent text. The attack then prompts the LLM to extract the hidden query and respond in an encrypted manner. This approach effectively hides malicious intent while preserving naturalness, allowing it to evade both built-in and external safety mechanisms. We evaluate StegoAttack on four safety-aligned LLMs from major providers, benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art methods. StegoAttack achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 92.00%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11.0%. Its ASR drops by less than 1% even under external detection (e.g., Llama Guard). Moreover, it attains the optimal comprehensive scores on stealth detection metrics, demonstrating both high efficacy and exceptional stealth capabilities.

    <h3>TRIM: Achieving Extreme Sparsity with Targeted Row-wise Iterative   Metric-driven Pruning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions (rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at: https://github.com/flobk/TRIM</div>

    <div class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in global applications, ensuring that they are toxicity-free across diverse linguistic contexts remains a critical challenge. We explore "Cross-lingual Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's effectiveness through 504 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between safety and knowledge preservation. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/himanshubeniwal/Breaking-mBad.</div>

    <div class="abstract">High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models (LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.</div>

    <h3>O$^2$-Searcher: A Searching-based Agent Model for Open-Domain Open-Ended   Question Answering</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning.
