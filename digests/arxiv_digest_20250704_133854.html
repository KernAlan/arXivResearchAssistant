    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens. To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose $\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose \textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared to baselines.

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Patents contain rich technical knowledge that can inspire innovative product ideas, yet accessing and interpreting this information remains a challenge. This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work, we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges, we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces, offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.</div>

    <h3>Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model   Evaluation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate. However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading. Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and "non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process. This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this, we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by 36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing. Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token cost.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol (KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection).</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence, reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation, they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization, and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each component and the quality of generated keywords.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly, requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation. However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations. Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic heuristic evaluations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say") correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act"). Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate; (2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game; and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated (or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of 7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical alignment than traditional approaches.</div>

    <h3>Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for   Dialogue Summarization</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks, our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for real-world dialogue summarization.</div>

    <h3>Energy-Based Transformers are Scalable Learners and Thinkers</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking, have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific (e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2 Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters, FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance, suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently, EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models.</div>

    <h3>Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization.</div>
