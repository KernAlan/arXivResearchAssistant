    <div class="abstract">Security threats like prompt injection attacks pose significant risks to applications that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs), potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as API misuse. Unlike previous approaches that aim to detect these attacks on a best-effort basis, this paper introduces a novel method that appends an Encrypted Prompt to each user prompt, embedding current permissions. These permissions are verified before executing any actions (such as API calls) generated by the LLM. If the permissions are insufficient, the LLM's actions will not be executed, ensuring safety. This approach guarantees that only actions within the scope of the current permissions from the LLM can proceed. In scenarios where adversarial prompts are introduced to mislead the LLM, this method ensures that any unauthorized actions from LLM wouldn't be executed by verifying permissions in Encrypted Prompt. Thus, threats like prompt injection attacks that trigger LLM to generate harmful actions can be effectively mitigated.</div>

    <h3>Agentic Large Language Models, a survey</h3>

    <div class="abstract">There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this research, we introduce BEATS, a novel framework for evaluating Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon the BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure performance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of characteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well as measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related misinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the extent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that reinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this benchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it a rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on data from our experiment show that, 37.65\% of outputs generated by industry leading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of using these models in critical decision making systems. BEATS framework and benchmark offer a scalable and statistically rigorous methodology to benchmark LLMs, diagnose factors driving biases, and develop mitigation strategies. With the BEATS framework, our goal is to help the development of more socially responsible and ethically aligned AI models.</div>

    <h3>AirCache: Activating Inter-modal Relevancy KV Cache Compression for   Efficient Large Vision-Language Model Inference</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential and impressive performance in automating the generation and optimization of workflows. However, existing approaches are marked by limited reasoning capabilities, high computational demands, and significant resource requirements. To address these issues, we propose DebFlow, a framework that employs a debate mechanism to optimize workflows and integrates reflexion to improve based on previous experiences. We evaluated our method across six benchmark datasets, including HotpotQA, MATH, and ALFWorld. Our approach achieved a 3\% average performance improvement over the latest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse problem domains. In particular, during training, our framework reduces resource consumption by 37\% compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we performed ablation studies. Removing the Debate component resulted in a 4\% performance drop across two benchmark datasets, significantly greater than the 2\% drop observed when the Reflection component was removed. These findings strongly demonstrate the critical role of Debate in enhancing framework performance, while also highlighting the auxiliary contribution of reflexion to overall optimization.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) can carry out human-like dialogue, but unlike humans, they are stateless due to the superposition property. However, during multi-turn, multi-agent interactions, LLMs begin to exhibit consistent, character-like behaviors, hinting at a form of emergent lifelong learning. Despite this, existing benchmarks often fail to capture these dynamics, primarily focusing on static, open-ended evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce LIFESTATE-BENCH, a benchmark designed to assess lifelong learning in LLMs. It features two episodic datasets: Hamlet and a synthetic script collection, rich in narrative structure and character interactions. Our fact checking evaluation probes models' self-awareness, episodic memory retrieval, and relationship tracking, across both parametric and non-parametric approaches. Experiments on models like Llama3.1-8B, GPT-4-turbo, and DeepSeek R1, we demonstrate that nonparametric methods significantly outperform parametric ones in managing stateful learning. However, all models exhibit challenges with catastrophic forgetting as interactions extend, highlighting the need for further advancements in lifelong learning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated data analytics and machine learning by enabling dynamic reasoning and adaptability. While recent approaches have advanced multi-stage pipelines through multi-agent systems, they typically rely on rigid, single-path workflows that limit the exploration and integration of diverse strategies, often resulting in suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Cross-lingual open-ended generation -- i.e. generating responses in a desired language different from that of the user's query -- is an important yet understudied problem. We introduce XL-AlpacaEval, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generation capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), and propose XL-Instruct, a high-quality synthetic data generation method. Fine-tuning with just 8K XL-Instruct-generated instructions significantly improves model performance, increasing the win rate against GPT-4o-Mini from 7.4% to 21.5%, and improving on several fine-grained quality metrics. Additionally, models fine-tuned on XL-Instruct exhibit strong zero-shot transfer to both English-only and multilingual generation tasks. Given its consistent gains across the board, we strongly recommend incorporating XL-Instruct in the post-training pipeline of future multilingual LLMs. To facilitate further research, we will publicly and freely release the XL-Instruct and XL-AlpacaEval datasets, which constitute two of the few cross-lingual resources currently available in the literature.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2). While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In e-commerce, behavioral data is collected for decision making which can be costly and slow. Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising alternative for representing human population behavior. However, LLMs are known to exhibit certain biases, such as brand bias, review rating bias and limited representation of certain groups in the population, hence they need to be carefully benchmarked and aligned to user behavior. Ultimately, our goal is to synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional "individual" level. Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an initial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and compare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications, limitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Collecting high-quality training data is essential for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). However, acquiring such data is often costly and time-consuming, especially for non-English languages such as Italian. Recently, researchers have begun to explore the use of LLMs to generate synthetic datasets as a viable alternative. This study proposes a pipeline for generating synthetic data and a comprehensive approach for investigating the factors that influence the validity of synthetic data generated by LLMs by examining how model performance is affected by metrics such as prompt strategy, text length and target position in a specific task, i.e. inclusive language detection in Italian job advertisements. Our results show that, in most cases and across different metrics, the fine-tuned models trained on synthetic data consistently outperformed other models on both real and synthetic test datasets. The study discusses the practical implications and limitations of using synthetic data for language detection tasks with LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Key-Value cache (\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache}) compression has emerged as a promising technique to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) serving. It primarily decreases the memory consumption of \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} to reduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression algorithms, their applications in production environments are still not prevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and benchmark studies for \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression and identify missing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their adoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that affect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g., FlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM serving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased end-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of individual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic limitations in \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression when handling specific LLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in production.

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources and incorporating them into the context. While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications.

    <h3>Thinking Longer, Not Larger: Enhancing Software Engineering Agents via   Scaling Test-Time Compute</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in software engineering agents have demonstrated promising capabilities in automating program improvements. However, their reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question: \textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code reasoning performance?}   To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling, rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally, we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods.   Evaluations on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate our \textbf{32B model achieves a 46\% issue resolution rate}, surpassing significantly larger models such as DeepSeek R1 671B and OpenAI o1. Additionally, we provide the empirical validation of the test-time scaling phenomenon within SWE agents, revealing that \textbf{models dynamically allocate more tokens to increasingly challenging problems}, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities. We publicly release all training data, models, and code to facilitate future research. https://github.com/yingweima2022/SWE-Reasoner</div>

    <h3>LANID: LLM-assisted New Intent Discovery</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TODS) often face the challenge of encountering new intents. New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that aims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to recognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have struggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external knowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their scale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive queries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs, we propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of lightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs the $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the training set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between these pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a contrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with a contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

    <h3>Finding Interest Needle in Popularity Haystack: Improving Retrieval by   Modeling Item Exposure</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recommender systems operate in closed feedback loops, where user interactions reinforce popularity bias, leading to over-recommendation of already popular items while under-exposing niche or novel content. Existing bias mitigation methods, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and Off- Policy Correction (OPC), primarily operate at the ranking stage or during training, lacking explicit real-time control over exposure dynamics. In this work, we introduce an exposure- aware retrieval scoring approach, which explicitly models item exposure probability and adjusts retrieval-stage ranking at inference time. Unlike prior work, this method decouples exposure effects from engagement likelihood, enabling controlled trade-offs between fairness and engagement in large-scale recommendation platforms. We validate our approach through online A/B experiments in a real-world video recommendation system, demonstrating a 25% increase in uniquely retrieved items and a 40% reduction in the dominance of over-popular content, all while maintaining overall user engagement levels. Our results establish a scalable, deployable solution for mitigating popularity bias at the retrieval stage, offering a new paradigm for bias-aware personalization.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on many NLP tasks, yet often exhibit order dependence: simply reordering semantically identical tokens (e.g., answer choices in multiple-choice questions) can lead to inconsistent predictions. Recent work proposes Set-Based Prompting (SBP) as a way to remove order information from designated token subsets, thereby mitigating positional biases. However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, "pulling" these set-formatted prompts closer to the model's training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities. We discuss the broader implications of order-invariant modeling and outline future directions for building fairer, more consistent LLMs.</div>
