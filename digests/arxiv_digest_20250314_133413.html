    <div class="abstract">Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks. However, existing RAG methods do not adequately utilize the naturally inherent hierarchical knowledge in human cognition, which limits the capabilities of RAG systems. In this paper, we introduce a new RAG approach, called HiRAG, which utilizes hierarchical knowledge to enhance the semantic understanding and structure capturing capabilities of RAG systems in the indexing and retrieval processes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HiRAG achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline methods. The code of our proposed method is available at \href{https://github.com/hhy-huang/HiRAG}{https://github.com/hhy-huang/HiRAG}.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Operations Research (OR) has been widely applied in various fields such as resource allocation, production planning, and supply chain management. However, addressing real-world OR problems requires OR experts to perform mathematical modeling and programmers to develop solution algorithms. This traditional method, heavily reliant on experts, is costly and has long development cycles, severely limiting the widespread adoption of OR techniques. Few have considered using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace professionals to achieve fully automated solutions for OR problems. We propose OR-LLM-Agent, the first AI agent that enables end-to-end automation for solving real-world OR problems. OR-LLM-Agent leverages the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language problem descriptions into formal mathematical models and automatically generate Gurobi solver code. In OR-LLM-Agent, OR-CodeAgent is designed to automate code execution and repair within a sandbox environment, facilitating the derivation of the final solution. Due to the lack of dedicated benchmark datasets for evaluating the automated solving of OR problems, we construct a benchmark dataset comprising 83 real-world OR problems described in natural language. We conduct comparative experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs, including GPT-o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. The OR-LLM-Agent achieved the highest pass rate of 100% and the highest solution accuracy of 85%, demonstrating the feasibility of automated OR problem-solving. Data and code have been publicly available at https://github.com/bwz96sco/or_llm_agent.</div>

    <h3>Sometimes Painful but Certainly Promising: Feasibility and Trade-offs of   Language Model Inference at the Edge</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) has expanded the capabilities of natural language processing, powering applications from text generation to complex decision-making. While state-of-the-art LMs often boast hundreds of billions of parameters and are primarily deployed in data centers, recent trends show a growing focus on compact models-typically under 10 billion parameters-enabled by techniques such as quantization and other model compression techniques. This shift paves the way for LMs on edge devices, offering potential benefits such as enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and improved data sovereignty. However, the inherent complexity of even these smaller models, combined with the limited computing resources of edge hardware, raises critical questions about the practical trade-offs in executing LM inference outside the cloud. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive evaluation of generative LM inference on representative CPU-based and GPU-accelerated edge devices. Our study measures key performance indicators-including memory usage, inference speed, and energy consumption-across various device configurations. Additionally, we examine throughput-energy trade-offs, cost considerations, and usability, alongside an assessment of qualitative model performance. While quantization helps mitigate memory overhead, it does not fully eliminate resource bottlenecks, especially for larger models. Our findings quantify the memory and energy constraints that must be considered for practical real-world deployments, offering concrete insights into the trade-offs between model size, inference performance, and efficiency. The exploration of LMs at the edge is still in its early stages. We hope this study provides a foundation for future research, guiding the refinement of models, the enhancement of inference efficiency, and the advancement of edge-centric AI systems.</div>

    <h3>JBFuzz: Jailbreaking LLMs Efficiently and Effectively Using Fuzzing</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language understanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various aspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs.   JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing medical diagnostics by enhancing both disease classification and clinical decision-making. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Sequence-to-sequence tasks often benefit from long contexts, but the quadratic complexity of self-attention in standard Transformers renders this non-trivial. During generation, temporary representations -stored in the so-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale linearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance. We demonstrate the generalizability of KV-Distill across various model sizes and architectures.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recommender systems (RecSys) are widely used across various modern digital platforms and have garnered significant attention. Traditional recommender systems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making it difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an interactive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their evolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation assistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt templates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of personalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their capabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual user queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them unsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To address this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to access LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era of LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard conditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated commonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs are better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing challenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading information. Our dataset has been released at https://github.com/jiani-huang/RecBench.git.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Query and product relevance prediction is a critical component for ensuring a smooth user experience in e-commerce search. Traditional studies mainly focus on BERT-based models to assess the semantic relevance between queries and products. However, the discriminative paradigm and limited knowledge capacity of these approaches restrict their ability to comprehend the relevance between queries and products fully. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent research has begun to explore their application to industrial search systems, as LLMs provide extensive world knowledge and flexible optimization for reasoning processes. Nonetheless, directly leveraging LLMs for relevance prediction tasks introduces new challenges, including a high demand for data quality, the necessity for meticulous optimization of reasoning processes, and an optimistic bias that can result in over-recall. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called the LLM-based RElevance Framework (LREF) aimed at enhancing e-commerce search relevance. The framework comprises three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Data Selection, Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for de-biasing. We evaluate the performance of the framework through a series of offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, as well as online A/B testing. The results indicate significant improvements in both offline and online metrics. Ultimately, the model was deployed in a well-known e-commerce application, yielding substantial commercial benefits.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The next generation of active safety features in autonomous vehicles should be capable of safely executing evasive hazard-avoidance maneuvers akin to those performed by professional stunt drivers to achieve high-agility motion at the limits of vehicle handling. This paper presents a novel framework, ManeuverGPT, for generating and executing high-dynamic stunt maneuvers in autonomous vehicles using large language model (LLM)-based agents as controllers. We target aggressive maneuvers, such as J-turns, within the CARLA simulation environment and demonstrate an iterative, prompt-based approach to refine vehicle control parameters, starting tabula rasa without retraining model weights. We propose an agentic architecture comprised of three specialized agents (1) a Query Enricher Agent for contextualizing user commands, (2) a Driver Agent for generating maneuver parameters, and (3) a Parameter Validator Agent that enforces physics-based and safety constraints. Experimental results demonstrate successful J-turn execution across multiple vehicle models through textual prompts that adapt to differing vehicle dynamics. We evaluate performance via established success criteria and discuss limitations regarding numeric precision and scenario complexity. Our findings underscore the potential of LLM-driven control for flexible, high-dynamic maneuvers, while highlighting the importance of hybrid approaches that combine language-based reasoning with algorithmic validation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce Siege, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</div>

    <h3>TruthPrInt: Mitigating LVLM Object Hallucination Via Latent   Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Object Hallucination (OH) has been acknowledged as one of the major trustworthy challenges in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/TruthPrInt.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in code generation tasks. However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in enabling pre-trained LLMs to evolve from general language comprehension to task-specific expertise. To preserve user data privacy, federated fine-tuning is often employed and has emerged as the de facto paradigm. However, federated fine-tuning is prohibitively inefficient due to the tension between LLM complexity and the resource constraint of end devices, incurring unaffordable fine-tuning overhead. Existing literature primarily utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate communication costs, yet computational and memory burdens continue to pose significant challenges for developers. This work proposes DropPEFT, an innovative federated PEFT framework that employs a novel stochastic transformer layer dropout method, enabling devices to deactivate a considerable fraction of LLMs layers during training, thereby eliminating the associated computational load and memory footprint. In DropPEFT, a key challenge is the proper configuration of dropout ratios for layers, as overhead and training performance are highly sensitive to this setting. To address this challenge, we adaptively assign optimal dropout-ratio configurations to devices through an exploration-exploitation strategy, achieving efficient and effective fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that DropPEFT can achieve a 1.3-6.3\times speedup in model convergence and a 40%-67% reduction in memory footprint compared to state-of-the-art methods.</div>

    <h3>Advanced Tool Learning and Selection System (ATLASS): A Closed-Loop   Framework Using LLM</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The combination of LLM agents with external tools enables models to solve complex tasks beyond their knowledge base. Human-designed tools are inflexible and restricted to solutions within the scope of pre-existing tools created by experts. To address this problem, we propose ATLASS, an advanced tool learning and selection system designed as a closed-loop framework. It enables the LLM to solve problems by dynamically generating external tools on demand. In this framework, agents play a crucial role in orchestrating tool selection, execution, and refinement, ensuring adaptive problem-solving capabilities. The operation of ATLASS follows three phases: The first phase, Understanding Tool Requirements, involves the Agents determining whether tools are required and specifying their functionality; the second phase, Tool Retrieval/Generation, involves the Agents retrieving or generating tools based on their availability; and the third phase, Task Solving, involves combining all the component tools necessary to complete the initial task. The Tool Dataset stores the generated tools, ensuring reusability and minimizing inference cost. Current LLM-based tool generation systems have difficulty creating complex tools that need APIs or external packages. In ATLASS, we solve the problem by automatically setting up the environment, fetching relevant API documentation online, and using a Python interpreter to create a reliable, versatile tool that works in a wider range of situations. OpenAI GPT-4.0 is used as the LLM agent, and safety and ethical concerns are handled through human feedback before executing generated code. By addressing the limitations of predefined toolsets and enhancing adaptability, ATLASS serves as a real-world solution that empowers users with dynamically generated tools for complex problem-solving.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper investigates the complex interplay between AI developers, regulators, users, and the media in fostering trustworthy AI systems. Using evolutionary game theory and large language models (LLMs), we model the strategic interactions among these actors under different regulatory regimes. The research explores two key mechanisms for achieving responsible governance, safe AI development and adoption of safe AI: incentivising effective regulation through media reporting, and conditioning user trust on commentariats' recommendation. The findings highlight the crucial role of the media in providing information to users, potentially acting as a form of "soft" regulation by investigating developers or regulators, as a substitute to institutional AI regulation (which is still absent in many regions). Both game-theoretic analysis and LLM-based simulations reveal conditions under which effective regulation and trustworthy AI development emerge, emphasising the importance of considering the influence of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game-theoretic perspective. The study concludes that effective governance requires managing incentives and costs for high quality commentaries.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in diverse scenarios, the extent to which they could tacitly spread misinformation emerges as a critical safety concern. Current research primarily evaluates LLMs on explicit false statements, overlooking how misinformation often manifests subtly as unchallenged premises in real-world user interactions. We curated ECHOMIST, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where the misinformed assumptions are embedded in a user query to LLMs. ECHOMIST is based on rigorous selection criteria and carefully curated data from diverse sources, including real-world human-AI conversations and social media interactions. We also introduce a new evaluation metric to measure whether LLMs can recognize and counter false information rather than amplify users' misconceptions. Through an extensive empirical study on a wide range of LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating misleading explanations. Our findings underscore the critical need for an increased focus on implicit misinformation in LLM safety research.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Building effective and efficient Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has recently become a research focus, requiring maximizing model language capabilities and minimizing training and deployment costs. Existing efforts have primarily described complex relationships among model performance, parameter size, and data size, as well as searched for the optimal compute allocation to train LLMs. However, they overlook the impacts of context length and attention head configuration (the number of query and key-value heads in grouped-query attention) on training and inference. In this paper, we systematically compare models with different parameter sizes, context lengths, and attention head configurations in terms of model performance, computational cost, and memory cost. Then, we extend the existing scaling methods, which are based solely on parameter size and training compute, to guide the construction of cost-optimal LLMs during both training and inference. Our quantitative scaling studies show that, when processing sufficiently long sequences, a larger model with fewer attention heads can achieve a lower loss while incurring lower computational and memory costs. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical LLMs, especially in long-context processing scenarios. We will publicly release our code and data.</div>
