    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing demand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

    <div class="abstract">Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy deployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and broader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which is computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a mechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However, single-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due to the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the test-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of agent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned LLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture of agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for inference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among multiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen from a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This policy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step, enabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance with respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given off-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with open-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates the merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably, Collab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement of up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks. To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human. State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring non-trivial prompt engineering).   In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic research investigations in future.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL, driven by large language models, are democratizing data access. Despite these advancements, enterprise deployments remain challenging due to the need to capture business-specific knowledge, handle complex queries, and meet expectations of continuous improvements. To address these issues, we designed and implemented GenEdit: our Text-to-SQL generation system that improves with user feedback. GenEdit builds and maintains a company-specific knowledge set, employs a pipeline of operators decomposing SQL generation, and uses feedback to update its knowledge set to improve future SQL generations.   We describe GenEdit's architecture made of two core modules: (i) decomposed SQL generation; and (ii) knowledge set edits based on user feedback. For generation, GenEdit leverages compounding operators to improve knowledge retrieval and to create a plan as chain-of-thought steps that guides generation. GenEdit first retrieves relevant examples in an initial retrieval stage where original SQL queries are decomposed into sub-statements, clauses or sub-queries. It then also retrieves instructions and schema elements. Using the retrieved contextual information, GenEdit then generates step-by-step plan in natural language on how to produce the query. Finally, GenEdit uses the plan to generate SQL, minimizing the need for model reasoning, which enhances complex SQL generation. If necessary, GenEdit regenerates the query based on syntactic and semantic errors. The knowledge set edits are recommended through an interactive copilot, allowing users to iterate on their feedback and to regenerate SQL queries as needed. Each generation uses staged edits which update the generation prompt. Once the feedback is submitted, it gets merged after passing regression testing and obtaining an approval, improving future generations.</div>

    <h3>SWI: Speaking with Intent in Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we propose a metric called Number of Thoughts (NofT) to determine the difficulty of tasks pre-prompting and support Large Language Models (LLMs) in production contexts. By setting thresholds based on the number of thoughts, this metric can discern the difficulty of prompts and support more effective prompt routing. A 2% decrease in latency is achieved when routing prompts from the MathInstruct dataset through quantized, distilled versions of Deepseek with 1.7 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters. Moreover, this metric can be used to detect adversarial prompts used in prompt injection attacks with high efficacy. The Number of Thoughts can inform a classifier that achieves 95% accuracy in adversarial prompt detection.

    <div class="abstract">The success of large language models has garnered widespread attention for model merging techniques, especially training-free methods which combine model capabilities within the parameter space. However, two challenges remain: (1) uniform treatment of all parameters leads to performance degradation; (2) search-based algorithms are often inefficient. In this paper, we present an innovative framework termed Reinforced Model Merging (RMM), which encompasses an environment and agent tailored for merging tasks. These components interact to execute layer-wise merging actions, aiming to search the optimal merging architecture. Notably, RMM operates without any gradient computations on the original models, rendering it feasible for edge devices. Furthermore, by utilizing data subsets during the evaluation process, we addressed the bottleneck in the reward feedback phase, thereby accelerating RMM by up to 100 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various vision and NLP datasets and effectively overcomes the limitations of the existing baseline methods.

    <div class="abstract">Advancements in retrieving accessible information have evolved faster in the last few years compared to the decades since the internet's creation. Search engines, like Google, have been the number one way to find relevant data. They have always relied on the user's abilities to find the best information in its billions of links and sources at everybody's fingertips. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has completely transformed the field of information retrieval. The LLMs excel not only at retrieving relevant knowledge but also at summarizing it effectively, making information more accessible and consumable for users. On top of it, the rise of AI Agents has introduced another aspect to information retrieval i.e. dynamic information retrieval which enables the integration of real-time data such as weather forecasts, and financial data with the knowledge base to curate context-aware knowledge. However, despite these advancements the agents remain susceptible to issues of bias and fairness, challenges deeply rooted within the knowledge base and training of LLMs. This study introduces a novel approach to bias-aware knowledge retrieval by leveraging agentic framework and the innovative use of bias detectors as tools to identify and highlight inherent biases in the retrieved content. By empowering users with transparency and awareness, this approach aims to foster more equitable information systems and promote the development of responsible AI.</div>

Thinker effectively closes the gap in reasoning capabilities between the base models by introducing proper structure.   The key features of the Thinker framework are: (1) State-Machine Augmented Generation (SMAG), which represents business logic as state machines and the LLM uses state machines as tools. (2) Delegation of tasks from the main reasoning loop to LLM-powered tools. (3) Adaptive context management.   Our prompting-only solution achieves signficant gains, while still maintaining a standard agentic architecture with a ReAct style reasoning loop. The key is to innovate on the tool interface design, as exemplified by SMAG and the LLM-powered tools.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have increased interest in deploying them on mobile devices for on-device AI applications. Mobile users interact differently with LLMs compared to desktop users, creating unique expectations and data biases. Current benchmark datasets primarily target at server and desktop environments, and there is a notable lack of extensive datasets specifically designed for mobile contexts. Additionally, mobile devices face strict limitations in storage and computing resources, constraining model size and capabilities, thus requiring optimized efficiency and prioritized knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-MMLU, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for mobile intelligence. It consists of 16,186 questions across 80 mobile-related fields, designed to evaluate LLM performance in realistic mobile scenarios. A challenging subset, Mobile-MMLU-Pro, provides advanced evaluation similar in size to MMLU-Pro but significantly more difficult than our standard full set. Both benchmarks use multiple-choice, order-invariant questions focused on practical mobile interactions, such as recipe suggestions, travel planning, and essential daily tasks. The dataset emphasizes critical mobile-specific metrics like inference latency, energy consumption, memory usage, and response quality, offering comprehensive insights into model performance under mobile constraints. Moreover, it prioritizes privacy and adaptability, assessing models' ability to perform on-device processing, maintain user privacy, and adapt to personalized usage patterns. Mobile-MMLU family offers a standardized framework for developing and comparing mobile-optimized LLMs, enabling advancements in productivity and decision-making within mobile computing environments.

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred significant interest in tool learning, where LLMs are augmented with external tools to tackle complex tasks. However, existing tool environments face challenges in balancing stability, scalability, and realness, particularly for benchmarking purposes. To address this problem, we propose MirrorAPI, a novel framework that trains specialized LLMs to accurately simulate real API responses, effectively acting as "mirrors" to tool environments. Using a comprehensive dataset of request-response pairs from 7,000+ APIs, we employ supervised fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance simulation fidelity. MirrorAPI achieves superior accuracy and stability compared to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by its performance on the newly constructed MirrorAPI-Bench and its integration into StableToolBench.</div>

    <h3>Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Token Redundancy Reduction</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) aims to transfer pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks by learning a small number of parameters. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, which updates the entire model, PET significantly reduces storage and transfer costs for each task regardless of exponentially increasing pre-trained model capacity. However, most PET methods inherit the inference latency of their large backbone models and often introduce additional computational overhead due to additional modules (e.g. adapters), limiting their practicality for compute-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning (FPET), a novel approach that enhances inference speed and training efficiency while maintaining high storage efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play token redundancy reduction module delicately designed for PET. This module refines tokens from the self-attention layer using an adapter to learn the accurate similarity between tokens and cuts off the tokens through a fully-differentiable token merging strategy, which uses a straight-through estimator for optimal token reduction. Experimental results prove that our FPET achieves faster inference and higher memory efficiency than the pre-trained backbone while keeping competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art PET methods.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents, autonomously performing tasks within real desktop or web environments. While this evolution greatly expands practical use cases for humans, it also creates serious security exposures. We present SUDO (Screen-based Universal Detox2Tox Offense), a novel attack framework that systematically bypasses refusal trained safeguards in commercial computer-use agents, such as Claude Computer Use. The core mechanism, Detox2Tox, transforms harmful requests (that agents initially reject) into seemingly benign requests via detoxification, secures detailed instructions from advanced vision language models (VLMs), and then reintroduces malicious content via toxification just before execution. Unlike conventional jailbreaks, SUDO iteratively refines its attacks based on a built-in refusal feedback, making it increasingly effective against robust policy filters. In extensive tests spanning 50 real-world tasks and multiple state-of-the-art VLMs, SUDO achieves a stark attack success rate of 24% (with no refinement), and up to 41% (by its iterative refinement) in Claude Computer Use. By revealing these vulnerabilities and demonstrating the ease with which they can be exploited in real-world computing environments, this paper highlights an immediate need for robust, context-aware safeguards.

    <div class="abstract">Object Goal Navigation (OGN) is a fundamental task for robots and AI, with key applications such as mobile robot image databases (MRID). In particular, mapless OGN is essential in scenarios involving unknown or dynamic environments. This study aims to enhance recent modular mapless OGN systems by leveraging the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we address the challenge of determining the visiting order in frontier-based exploration by framing it as a frontier ranking problem. Our approach is grounded in recent findings that, while LLMs cannot determine the absolute value of a frontier, they excel at evaluating the relative value between multiple frontiers viewed within a single image using the view image as context. We dynamically manage the frontier list by adding and removing elements, using an LLM as a ranking model. The ranking results are represented as reciprocal rank vectors, which are ideal for multi-view, multi-query information fusion. We validate the effectiveness of our method through evaluations in Habitat-Sim.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed a transformative leap with the advent of transformer-based architectures, which have significantly enhanced the ability of machines to understand and generate human-like text. This paper explores the advancements in transformer models, such as BERT and GPT, focusing on their superior performance in text understanding tasks compared to traditional methods like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By analyzing statistical properties through visual representations-including probability density functions of text length distributions and feature space classifications-the study highlights the models' proficiency in handling long-range dependencies, adapting to conditional shifts, and extracting features for classification, even with overlapping classes. Drawing on recent 2024 research, including enhancements in multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning and context-aware chat interactions, the paper outlines a methodology involving data preparation, model selection, pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD, with F1 scores exceeding 90%, though challenges such as high computational costs persist. This work underscores the pivotal role of transformers in modern NLP and suggests future directions, including efficiency optimization and multimodal integration, to further advance language-based AI systems.</div>
