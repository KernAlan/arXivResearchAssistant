    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score, which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time scaling performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge domain.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce xLLM, an intelligent and efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference framework designed for high-performance, large-scale enterprise-grade serving, with deep optimizations for diverse AI accelerators. To address these challenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the service layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that efficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline tasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This module also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD) disaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation policy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a distributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust fault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer, xLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate computing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer execution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory management. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such as optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to substantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource efficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to 1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while maintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series models. xLLM framework is publicly available at https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm and https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm-service.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories, Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.</div>

    <h3>Formalizing the Safety, Security, and Functional Properties of Agentic   AI Systems</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical, especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion, providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together, these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17 properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic, these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states, a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model, highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.</div>

    <h3>JSPLIT: A Taxonomy-based Solution for Prompt Bloating in Model Context   Protocol</h3>

    <div class="abstract">AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools, based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent, effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in high-complexity agent environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In large scale recommendation systems like the LinkedIn Feed, the retrieval stage is critical for narrowing hundreds of millions of potential candidates to a manageable subset for ranking. LinkedIn's Feed serves suggested content from outside of the member's network (based on the member's topical interests), where 2000 candidates are retrieved from a pool of hundreds of millions candidate with a latency budget of a few milliseconds and inbound QPS of several thousand per second. This paper presents a novel retrieval approach that fine-tunes a large causal language model (Meta's LLaMA 3) as a dual encoder to generate high quality embeddings for both users (members) and content (items), using only textual input. We describe the end to end pipeline, including prompt design for embedding generation, techniques for fine-tuning at LinkedIn's scale, and infrastructure for low latency, cost effective online serving. We share our findings on how quantizing numerical features in the prompt enables the information to get properly encoded in the embedding, facilitating greater alignment between the retrieval and ranking layer. The system was evaluated using offline metrics and an online A/B test, which showed substantial improvements in member engagement. We observed significant gains among newer members, who often lack strong network connections, indicating that high-quality suggested content aids retention. This work demonstrates how generative language models can be effectively adapted for real time, high throughput retrieval in industrial applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs) with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/ICDOPS-QA-2024.</div>

    <h3>Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 8/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards, low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool, providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback. Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples, amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality process-level reasoning.</div>

    <h3>Budget-aware Test-time Scaling via Discriminative Verification</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably, under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a "free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques.

    <div class="abstract">Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL) has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">User interests on content platforms are inherently diverse, manifesting through complex behavioral patterns across heterogeneous scenarios such as search, feed browsing, and content discovery. Traditional recommendation systems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated specific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling to integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which finally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform touchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender Engine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content recommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across multiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from varied scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its core, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted representations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing and querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture cross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific intents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on hundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing substantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement targeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation dataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation. Our work advances unified user modeling, unlocking deeper personalization and fostering more meaningful user engagement in large-scale UGC platforms.</div>

    <h3>ToolPRM: Fine-Grained Inference Scaling of Structured Outputs for   Function Calling</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating more computational resources during the inference process. However, current research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call. To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test: 13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.</div>
