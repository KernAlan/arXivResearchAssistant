    <div class="abstract">Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus, and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL, enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information retrieval systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM deployment.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2 emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation. Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy (58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

    <h3>Persona-Assigned Large Language Models Exhibit Human-Like Motivated   Reasoning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety, and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.</div>

    <h3>Can LLMs Replace Humans During Code Chunking?</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science, especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However, existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided modernization.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a "pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost, offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses. In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.</div>

    <h3>The Decrypto Benchmark for Multi-Agent Reasoning and Theory of Mind</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing interactive ToM experiments.   We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities. Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and paves the path towards better artificial agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader research community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute by sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live evaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with and leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community. Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context. CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2% human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions.

    <div class="abstract">This research addresses the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual code compliance checking in Building Information Modeling (BIM) by introducing a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approach to semi-automate this critical process. The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions, material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse regulatory documents in construction projects.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making. However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior. Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent driving systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge. However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix, which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model compression ratios.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under challenging evaluation scenarios.

    <div class="abstract">Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First, we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning integration in LLMs.</div>
