        <h3>ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights</h3>
        Hey boss, found 5 cool papers today that I think you'll love:

<ol>
<li>A team from Stanford introduced the Entropy Area Score (EAS), a new metric that helps quantify uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) without needing extra models or sampling. This could really enhance our training data selection process by identifying high-potential samples and improving accuracy, especially in math benchmarks. Super practical for fine-tuning LLMs!</li>

<li>Researchers highlight a critical vulnerability in using LLMs for data fitting. It turns out that even minor changes to data representation can drastically skew predictionsâ€”by up to 82%! This paper is a great reminder that while LLMs are powerful, we need to be cautious about their robustness when it comes to data tasks.</li>

<li>The GDS (Graph Data Science) agent is a game-changer for reasoning over large-scale graph data. It combines graph algorithms with LLMs and allows users to ask complex graph-based questions, yielding accurate answers quickly. This could open up a lot of possibilities for our projects that involve graph data!</li>

<li>MedGRÂ² proposes a new framework for generating high-quality medical data, tackling the issue of data scarcity head-on. By creating a self-improving system for data generation, it enhances the training of models for medical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results. This could really help us in developing robust medical AI solutions.</li>

<li>Lastly, there's a novel unlearning framework called EAGLE-PC that addresses privacy concerns in LLMs by effectively removing specific data without full retraining. It improves the balance between forgetting and utility, making it a solid enhancement for existing models. This could be crucial for ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations!</li>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets. In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets, improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</div>

    <h3>Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via   Entanglement-Aware Unlearning with Proxy Constraint</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of degraded utility.   In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering a scalable and robust unlearning solution.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization -- hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.   For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels, SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM performance engineering agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce HAMLET, a holistic and automated framework for evaluating the long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). HAMLET structures source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across model scales. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/HAMLET.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Context is critical for meaningful interactions between people and Generative AI (GenAI). Yet mainstream tools offer limited means to orchestrate it, particularly across workflows that span multiple interactions, sessions, and models, as often occurs in creative projects. Re specifying prior details, juggling diverse artifacts, and dealing with context drift overwhelm users, obscure intent, and curtail creativity. To address these challenges, we present Orchid, a system that gives its users affordances to specify, reference, and monitor context throughout evolving workflows. Specifically, Orchid enables users to (1) specify context related to the project, themselves, and different styles, (2) reference these via explicit mentions, inline selection, or implicit grounding, and (3) monitor context assigned to different interactions across the workflow. In a within-subjects study (n=12), participants using Orchid to execute creative tasks (compared to a baseline toolkit of web search, LLM-based chat, and digital notebooks) produced more novel and feasible outcomes, reporting greater alignment between their intent and the AI's responses, higher perceived control, and increased transparency. By prioritizing context orchestration, Orchid offers an actionable step toward next generation GenAI tools that support complex, iterative workflows - enabling creators and AI to stay aligned and augment their creative potential.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20 participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable feedback to improve LLM performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy, Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research and clinical translation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the capacity for thorough security assessment.   We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%) and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.   MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10 findings are under CVE review.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms, treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity, treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss. Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training (supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks. This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated, including when the guidelines are updated.

    <div class="abstract">Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper, we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple, fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions, demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive fine-tuning paradigms.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation, tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism, dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate}, and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}} (AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent, incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer, respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific computing paradigm.</div>

    <h3>MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model   Large-batch Training</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights. Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures. Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2 models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens. This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling faster development and iteration of large language models.

    <div class="abstract">The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However, previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label (output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains (input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared to the existing works.

    <h3>Governable AI: Provable Safety Under Extreme Threat Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible, and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.</div>
