    <div class="abstract">Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however, typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models, which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to 68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis, financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting, trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions. Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting, style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing LLM-based trading strategies.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures. We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective, proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules, (2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3) deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone, and impractical to scale.   We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts. Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud network.</div>

    <div class="abstract">AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.   At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.   Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.   Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science, Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts; and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and model backbones.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper, we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800 million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results. These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is available at https://github.com/rpo19/ReFactX.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo, and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time. Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays. Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits. Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our method.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear, actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models (LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes deep data science both accessible and actionable.</div>

We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models (LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world user queries.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios. Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive, understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents.

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI) cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient, we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions, and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while maintaining significantly lower inference time.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2) fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks. Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments, which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The code will be publicly available.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This work elaborates on a High performance computing (HPC) architecture based on Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) [1] for deploying heterogeneous Large Language Models (LLMs) into a scalable inference engine. Dynamic resource scheduling and seamless integration of containerized microservices have been leveraged herein to manage CPU, GPU, and memory allocations efficiently in multi-node clusters. Extensive experiments, using Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B parameters) [2] and Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) [3], probe throughput, latency, and concurrency and show that small models can handle up to 128 concurrent requests at sub-50 ms latency, while for larger models, saturation happens with as few as two concurrent users, with a latency of more than 2 seconds. This architecture includes Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces (REST APIs) [4] endpoints for single and bulk inferences, as well as advanced workflows such as multi-step "tribunal" refinement. Experimental results confirm minimal overhead from container and scheduling activities and show that the approach scales reliably both for batch and interactive settings. We further illustrate real-world scenarios, including the deployment of chatbots with retrievalaugmented generation, which helps to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the architecture. The obtained results pave ways for significantly more efficient, responsive, and fault-tolerant LLM inference on large-scale HPC infrastructures.</div>

    <h3>Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for future research in the area.</div>
