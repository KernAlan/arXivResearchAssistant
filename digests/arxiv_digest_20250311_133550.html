    <div class="abstract">Data Science tasks are multifaceted, dynamic, and often domain-specific. Existing LLM-based approaches largely concentrate on isolated phases, neglecting the interdependent nature of many data science tasks and limiting their capacity for comprehensive end-to-end support. We propose DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user, agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering. Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and accommodates LLM's limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rise of Agentic applications and automation in the Voice AI industry has led to an increased reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) to navigate graph-based logic workflows composed of nodes and edges. However, existing methods face challenges such as alignment errors in complex workflows and hallucinations caused by excessive context size. To address these limitations, we introduce the Performant Agentic Framework (PAF), a novel system that assists LLMs in selecting appropriate nodes and executing actions in order when traversing complex graphs. PAF combines LLM-based reasoning with a mathematically grounded vector scoring mechanism, achieving both higher accuracy and reduced latency. Our approach dynamically balances strict adherence to predefined paths with flexible node jumps to handle various user inputs efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that PAF significantly outperforms baseline methods, paving the way for scalable, real-time Conversational AI systems in complex business environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The impact of random seeds in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has been largely overlooked despite its potential influence on model performance.In this study, we systematically evaluate the effects of random seeds on LLMs using the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We analyze the macro-level impact through traditional metrics like accuracy and F1, calculating their mean and variance to quantify performance fluctuations. To capture the micro-level effects, we introduce a novel metric, consistency, measuring the stability of individual predictions across runs. Our experiments reveal significant variance at both macro and micro levels, underscoring the need for careful consideration of random seeds in fine-tuning and evaluation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Content moderation is a global challenge, yet major tech platforms prioritize high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with scarce native moderators. Since effective moderation depends on understanding contextual cues, this imbalance increases the risk of improper moderation due to non-native moderators' limited cultural understanding. Through a user study, we identify that non-native moderators struggle with interpreting culturally-specific knowledge, sentiment, and internet culture in the hate speech moderation. To assist them, we present LLM-C3MOD, a human-LLM collaborative pipeline with three steps: (1) RAG-enhanced cultural context annotations; (2) initial LLM-based moderation; and (3) targeted human moderation for cases lacking LLM consensus. Evaluated on a Korean hate speech dataset with Indonesian and German participants, our system achieves 78% accuracy (surpassing GPT-4o's 71% baseline), while reducing human workload by 83.6%. Notably, human moderators excel at nuanced contents where LLMs struggle. Our findings suggest that non-native moderators, when properly supported by LLMs, can effectively contribute to cross-cultural hate speech moderation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html</div>

    <div class="abstract">DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models often generate factually incorrect but plausible outputs, known as hallucinations. We identify a more insidious phenomenon, LLM delusion, defined as high belief hallucinations, incorrect outputs with abnormally high confidence, making them harder to detect and mitigate. Unlike ordinary hallucinations, delusions persist with low uncertainty, posing significant challenges to model reliability. Through empirical analysis across different model families and sizes on several Question Answering tasks, we show that delusions are prevalent and distinct from hallucinations. LLMs exhibit lower honesty with delusions, which are harder to override via finetuning or self reflection. We link delusion formation with training dynamics and dataset noise and explore mitigation strategies such as retrieval augmented generation and multi agent debating to mitigate delusions. By systematically investigating the nature, prevalence, and mitigation of LLM delusions, our study provides insights into the underlying causes of this phenomenon and outlines future directions for improving model reliability.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promising advancements in sequential decision-making tasks through task-specific fine-tuning. However, common fine-tuning methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), present notable limitations: SFT assumes Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data, while PPO focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards. These limitations often restrict solution diversity and hinder generalization in multi-step reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for complex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian decision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for real-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs to prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action selection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This approach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT and RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex tasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks (ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and stronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on familiar queries but struggle with specialized or emerging topics. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) addresses this by structuring domain knowledge as a graph for dynamic retrieval. However, existing pipelines involve complex engineering workflows, making it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components. Evaluating retrieval effectiveness is also challenging due to dataset overlap with LLM pretraining data. In this work, we introduce HuixiangDou2, a robustly optimized GraphRAG framework. Specifically, we leverage the effectiveness of dual-level retrieval and optimize its performance in a 32k context for maximum precision, and compare logic-based retrieval and dual-level retrieval to enhance overall functionality. Our implementation includes comparative experiments on a test set, where Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct initially underperformed. With our approach, the score improved significantly from 60 to 74.5, as illustrated in the Figure. Experiments on domain-specific datasets reveal that dual-level retrieval enhances fuzzy matching, while logic-form retrieval improves structured reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage verification mechanism to improve retrieval robustness without increasing computational cost. Empirical results show significant accuracy gains over baselines, highlighting the importance of adaptive retrieval. To support research and adoption, we release HuixiangDou2 as an open-source resource https://github.com/tpoisonooo/huixiangdou2.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we introduce InversePrompt, a novel self-corrective task planning approach that leverages inverse prompting to enhance interpretability. Our method incorporates reasoning steps to provide clear, interpretable feedback. It generates inverse actions corresponding to the initially generated actions and verifies whether these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, explicitly validating the logical coherence of the generated plans.The results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods. Our approach offers clearer justifications for feedback in real-world environments, resulting in more successful task completion than existing self-correction approaches across various scenarios.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Systems based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in industry. In the process of system operation, DNNs need to be updated in order to improve their performance. When updating DNNs, systems used in companies that require high reliability must have as few regressions as possible. Since the update of DNNs has a data-driven nature, it is difficult to suppress regressions as expected by developers. This paper identifies the requirements for DNN updating in industry and presents a case study using techniques to meet those requirements. In the case study, we worked on satisfying the requirement to update models trained on car images collected in Fujitsu assuming security applications without regression for a specific class. We were able to suppress regression by customizing the objective function based on NeuRecover, a DNN repair technique. Moreover, we discuss some of the challenges identified in the case study.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models. To address this, we propose DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach that simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses by harnessing this synergy. Our extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions.

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved multi-hop question answering (QA) through direct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the irreversible nature of CoT leads to error accumulation, making it challenging to correct mistakes in multi-hop reasoning. This paper introduces ReAgent: a Reversible multi-Agent collaborative framework augmented with explicit backtracking mechanisms, enabling reversible multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating text-based retrieval, information aggregation and validation, our system can detect and correct errors mid-reasoning, leading to more robust and interpretable QA outcomes. The framework and experiments serve as a foundation for future work on error-tolerant QA systems. Empirical evaluations across three benchmarks indicate ReAgent's efficacy, yielding average about 6\% improvements against baseline models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rise of agentic AI systems, where agents collaborate to perform diverse tasks, poses new challenges with observing, analyzing and optimizing their behavior. Traditional evaluation and benchmarking approaches struggle to handle the non-deterministic, context-sensitive, and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper explores key challenges and opportunities in analyzing and optimizing agentic systems across development, testing, and maintenance. We explore critical issues such as natural language variability and unpredictable execution flows, which hinder predictability and control, demanding adaptive strategies to manage input variability and evolving behaviors. Through our user study, we supported these hypotheses. In particular, we showed a 79% agreement that non deterministic flow of agentic systems acts as a major challenge. Finally, we validated our statements empirically advocating the need for moving beyond classical benchmarking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce taxonomies to present expected analytics outcomes and the ways to collect them by extending standard observability frameworks. Building on these foundations, we introduce and demonstrate novel approach for benchmarking of agent evaluation systems. Unlike traditional "black box" performance evaluation approaches, our benchmark is built from agent runtime logs as input, and analytics outcome including discovered flows and issues. By addressing key limitations in existing methodologies, we aim to set the stage for more advanced and holistic evaluation strategies, which could foster the development of adaptive, interpretable, and robust agentic AI systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Traditional agentic workflows rely on external prompts to manage interactions with tools and the environment, which limits the autonomy of reasoning models. We position \emph{Large Agent Models (LAMs)} that internalize the generation of \emph{Chain-of-Action (CoA)}, enabling the model to autonomously decide when and how to use external tools. Our proposed AutoCoA framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), allowing the model to seamlessly switch between reasoning and action while efficiently managing environment interactions. Main components include step-level action triggering, trajectory-level CoA optimization, and an internal world model to reduce real-environment interaction costs. Evaluations on open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that AutoCoA-trained agent models significantly outperform ReAct-based workflows in task completion, especially in tasks that require long-term reasoning and multi-step actions.

    <div class="abstract">This paper aims to address the challenge of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) particularly for dense image captioning tasks. To tackle the challenge, we identify the current lack of a metric that finely measures the caption quality in concept level. We hereby introduce HalFscore, a novel metric built upon the language graph and is designed to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of dense captions at a granular level. Additionally, we identify the root cause of hallucination as the model's over-reliance on its language prior. To address this, we propose PerturboLLaVA, which reduces the model's reliance on the language prior by incorporating adversarially perturbed text during training. This method enhances the model's focus on visual inputs, effectively reducing hallucinations and producing accurate, image-grounded descriptions without incurring additional computational overhead. PerturboLLaVA significantly improves the fidelity of generated captions, outperforming existing approaches in handling multimodal hallucinations and achieving improved performance across general multimodal benchmarks.</div>

    <h3>Seesaw: High-throughput LLM Inference via Model Re-sharding</h3>

    <div class="abstract">To improve the efficiency of distributed large language model (LLM) inference, various parallelization strategies, such as tensor and pipeline parallelism, have been proposed. However, the distinct computational characteristics inherent in the two stages of LLM inference-prefilling and decoding-render a single static parallelization strategy insufficient for the effective optimization of both stages. In this work, we present Seesaw, an LLM inference engine optimized for throughput-oriented tasks. The key idea behind Seesaw is dynamic model re-sharding, a technique that facilitates the dynamic reconfiguration of parallelization strategies across stages, thereby maximizing throughput at both phases. To mitigate re-sharding overhead and optimize computational efficiency, we employ tiered KV cache buffering and transition-minimizing scheduling. These approaches work synergistically to reduce the overhead caused by frequent stage transitions while ensuring maximum batching efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Seesaw achieves a throughput increase of up to 1.78x (1.36x on average) compared to vLLM, the most widely used state-of-the-art LLM inference engine.</div>
