    <div class="abstract">In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment, diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance. GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes, and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry, where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has redefined artificial intelligence (AI), pushing the boundaries of AI research and enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However, LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle, yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions from the perspective of software engineering (SE) approaches. To fill the gap, we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation, deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM development.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

    <div class="abstract">Despite advances in language and speech technologies, no open-source system enables full speech-to-speech, multi-turn dialogue with integrated tool use and agentic reasoning. We introduce AURA (Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and Automated Tool Use), the first open-source, speech-native assistant capable of completing complex, goal-driven tasks through dynamic tool invocation and multi-turn conversation. AURA combines open-weight ASR, TTS, and LLMs in a cascaded pipeline and supports tools such as calendar booking, contact lookup, web search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools using natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores 92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing GPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems. Human evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge exchange among developers, dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers' onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition, together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9% improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.</div>

    <h3>QPART: Adaptive Model Quantization and Dynamic Workload Balancing for   Accuracy-aware Edge Inference</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are considered when deciding.   Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below 1%.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs' abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide algorithm design.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic, open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment. These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety across the agent's decision-making loop.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce DABstep, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on realistic multi-step data analysis tasks. DABstep comprises over 450 real-world challenges derived from a financial analytics platform, requiring models to combine code-based data processing with contextual reasoning over heterogeneous documentation. Each task demands an iterative, multi-step problem-solving approach, testing capabilities in data manipulation, cross-referencing multiple sources, and precise result reporting. The benchmark provides a factoid-style answer format with automatic correctness checks for objective scoring at scale. We evaluate leading LLM-based agents, revealing a substantial performance gap: even the best agent achieves only 14.55% accuracy on the hardest tasks. We detail our benchmark's design, dataset composition, task formulation, evaluation protocol, report baseline results and analyze failure modes. DABstep is released with a public leaderboard and toolkit to accelerate research in autonomous data analysis.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI) with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2 Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result, the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private LLM systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by 1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15% while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment robustness in future LLM systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A) tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%.

    <h3>Thought-Augmented Planning for LLM-Powered Interactive Recommender Agent</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences. However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive, unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA) that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns. Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover, we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets, TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods. Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.</div>

    <h3>TuCo: Measuring the Contribution of Fine-Tuning to Individual Responses   of LLMs</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models' (LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states, providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and safety, and vice versa.</div>
