    <div class="abstract">Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs), powered by Transformers, have demonstrated human-like intelligence capabilities, yet their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This paper presents a novel framework for interpreting LLMs as probabilistic left context-sensitive languages (CSLs) generators. We hypothesize that Transformers can be effectively decomposed into three fundamental components: context windows, attention mechanisms, and autoregressive generation frameworks. This decomposition allows for the development of more flexible and interpretable computational models, moving beyond the traditional view of attention and autoregression as inseparable processes. We argue that next-token predictions can be understood as probabilistic, dynamic approximations of left CSL production rules, providing an intuitive explanation for how simple token predictions can yield human-like intelligence outputs. Given that all CSLs are left context-sensitive (Penttonen, 1974), we conclude that Transformers stochastically approximate CSLs, which are widely recognized as models of human-like intelligence. This interpretation bridges the gap between Formal Language Theory and the observed generative power of Transformers, laying a foundation for future advancements in generative AI theory and applications. Our novel perspective on Transformer architectures will foster a deeper understanding of LLMs and their future potentials.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Language model deployments in consumer-facing applications introduce numerous risks. While existing research on harms and hazards of such applications follows top-down approaches derived from regulatory frameworks and theoretical analyses, empirical evidence of real-world failure modes remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RealHarm, a dataset of annotated problematic interactions with AI agents built from a systematic review of publicly reported incidents. Analyzing harms, causes, and hazards specifically from the deployer's perspective, we find that reputational damage constitutes the predominant organizational harm, while misinformation emerges as the most common hazard category. We empirically evaluate state-of-the-art guardrails and content moderation systems to probe whether such systems would have prevented the incidents, revealing a significant gap in the protection of AI applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to scientific workflows, concerns over the confidentiality and ethical handling of confidential data have emerged. This paper explores data exposure risks through LLM-powered scientific tools, which can inadvertently leak confidential information, including intellectual property and proprietary data, from scientists' perspectives. We propose "DataShield", a framework designed to detect confidential data leaks, summarize privacy policies, and visualize data flow, ensuring alignment with organizational policies and procedures. Our approach aims to inform scientists about data handling practices, enabling them to make informed decisions and protect sensitive information.

    <div class="abstract">TextArena is an open-source collection of competitive text-based games for training and evaluation of agentic behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). It spans 57+ unique environments (including single-player, two-player, and multi-player setups) and allows for easy evaluation of model capabilities via an online-play system (against humans and other submitted models) with real-time TrueSkill scores. Traditional benchmarks rarely assess dynamic social skills such as negotiation, theory of mind, and deception, creating a gap that TextArena addresses. Designed with research, community and extensibility in mind, TextArena emphasizes ease of adding new games, adapting the framework, testing models, playing against the models, and training models.

    <h3>A Dual-Space Framework for General Knowledge Distillation of Large   Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.</div>

We propose OpenTuringBench, a new benchmark based on OLLMs, designed to train and evaluate machine-generated text detectors on the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution problems. OpenTuringBench focuses on a representative set of OLLMs, and features a number of challenging evaluation tasks, including human/machine-manipulated texts, out-of-domain texts, and texts from previously unseen models. We also provide OTBDetector, a contrastive learning framework to detect and attribute OLLM-based machine-generated texts.

    <div class="abstract">Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks, and their application in the medical domain holds particular promise due to the demand for high generalizability and reliance on interdisciplinary knowledge. However, existing medical agent systems often rely on static, manually crafted workflows that lack the flexibility to accommodate diverse diagnostic requirements and adapt to emerging clinical scenarios. Motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper introduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent architectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent search space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured modifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework conceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse, functional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by diagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures and significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time. This work represents the first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for deploying intelligent agents in real-world clinical environments.</div>

    <h3>A Rollout-Based Algorithm and Reward Function for Efficient Resource   Allocation in Business Processes</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Resource allocation plays a critical role in minimizing cycle time and improving the efficiency of business processes. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool to optimize resource allocation policies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy through interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that indicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not suitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore, existing DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate the desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead to undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the objective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating execution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function directly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the mean cycle time. Maximizing our reward function guarantees that the objective function is minimized without requiring extensive reward engineering. The results show that our method consistently learns the optimal policy in all six evaluated business processes, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithm that can only learn the optimal policy in two of the evaluated processes.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reasoning is the fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable, auto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first ever-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable testbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).</div>

    <div class="abstract">Small language models (SLMs) support efficient deployments on resource-constrained edge devices, but their limited capacity compromises inference performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution to enhance model performance by integrating external databases, without requiring intensive on-device model retraining. However, large-scale public databases and user-specific private contextual documents are typically located on the cloud and the device separately, while existing RAG implementations are primarily centralized. To bridge this gap, we propose DRAGON, a distributed RAG framework to enhance on-device SLMs through both general and personal knowledge without the risk of leaking document privacy. Specifically, DRAGON decomposes multi-document RAG into multiple parallel token generation processes performed independently and locally on the cloud and the device, and employs a newly designed Speculative Aggregation, a dual-side speculative algorithm to avoid frequent output synchronization between the cloud and device. A new scheduling algorithm is further introduced to identify the optimal aggregation side based on real-time network conditions. Evaluations on real-world hardware testbed demonstrate a significant performance improvement of DRAGON-up to 1.9x greater gains over standalone SLM compared to the centralized RAG, substantial reduction in per-token latency, and negligible Time to First Token (TTFT) overhead.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) mark a shift from general LLMs toward models designed for complex decision-making, a crucial aspect in medicine. However, their performance in specialized domains like ophthalmology remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluated and compared the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of four newly developed reasoning-focused LLMs, namely DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking. Each model was assessed using 5,888 multiple-choice ophthalmology exam questions from the MedMCQA dataset in zero-shot setting. Quantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed against ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a subset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified ophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning structure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and DeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in Macro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics varied: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and o1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with DeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest (6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized justifications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable outcomes in addressing complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet few works have explored the potential of LLM in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is how to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. In this paper, we address such a challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms to generate training data sets and construct the end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs that produce parameterized quantum circuits for optimization problems. We have prepared 14,000 quantum circuits covering a substantial part of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. The fine-tuned LLMs can construct syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in the most recent OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models and that the parameters are better than random. The LLM-generated parametrized circuits and initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, \emph{e.g.,} templates in quantum machine learning and the benchmark for compilers and hardware.</div>

    <h3>Dynamic Compressing Prompts for Efficient Inference of Large Language   Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, partly due to advanced prompting techniques. However, these techniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs and can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs. While prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods confront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context changes, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts (LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to preserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove redundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content. We develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the compression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key information. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external black-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum learning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training strategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the DCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information integrity. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially at higher compression rates. The code for our approach will be available at https://github.com/Fhujinwu/DCP.</div>

    <h3>Can LLMs Leverage Observational Data? Towards Data-Driven Causal   Discovery with LLMs</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Causal discovery traditionally relies on statistical methods applied to observational data, often requiring large datasets and assumptions about underlying causal structures. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for causal discovery by providing domain expert knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively process observational data for causal discovery. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery by integrating observational data for LLM-based reasoning. Specifically, we examine whether LLMs can effectively utilize observational data through two prompting strategies: pairwise prompting and breadth first search (BFS)-based prompting. In both approaches, we incorporate the observational data directly into the prompt to assess LLMs' ability to infer causal relationships from such data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that incorporating observational data enhances causal discovery, boosting F1 scores by up to 0.11 point using both pairwise and BFS LLM-based prompting, while outperforming traditional statistical causal discovery baseline by up to 0.52 points. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery, demonstrating their ability to move beyond textual metadata and effectively interpret and utilize observational data for more informed causal reasoning. Our studies lays the groundwork for future advancements toward fully LLM-driven causal discovery.</div>

    <h3>LOKA Protocol: A Decentralized Framework for Trustworthy and Ethical AI   Agent Ecosystems</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The rise of autonomous AI agents, capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting independently, signals a profound shift in how digital ecosystems operate, govern, and evolve. As these agents proliferate beyond centralized infrastructures, they expose foundational gaps in identity, accountability, and ethical alignment. Three critical questions emerge: Identity: Who or what is the agent? Accountability: Can its actions be verified, audited, and trusted? Ethical Consensus: Can autonomous systems reliably align with human values and prevent harmful emergent behaviors? We present the novel LOKA Protocol (Layered Orchestration for Knowledgeful Agents), a unified, systems-level architecture for building ethically governed, interoperable AI agent ecosystems. LOKA introduces a proposed Universal Agent Identity Layer (UAIL) for decentralized, verifiable identity; intent-centric communication protocols for semantic coordination across diverse agents; and a Decentralized Ethical Consensus Protocol (DECP) that enables agents to make context-aware decisions grounded in shared ethical baselines. Anchored in emerging standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and post-quantum cryptography, LOKA offers a scalable, future-resilient blueprint for multi-agent AI governance. By embedding identity, trust, and ethics into the protocol layer itself, LOKA establishes the foundation for a new era of responsible, transparent, and autonomous AI ecosystems operating across digital and physical domains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities and are receiving increasing attention to enhance their reasoning through scaling test--time compute. However, their application in open--ended, knowledge--intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited. Reasoning--oriented methods struggle to generalize to open--ended scenarios due to implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge--augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fail to address two core challenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through the chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore--exploit tradeoff arises in multi--branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of intermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval--augmented generation (RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables effective construction and optimization of reasoning plans across multiple maintained hypothesis branches. Experimental results show that ARise significantly outperforms the state--of--the--art KAR methods by up to 23.10%, and the latest RAG-equipped large reasoning models by up to 25.37%.</div>
