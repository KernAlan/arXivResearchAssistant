    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the project page at https://auto-safe.github.io/.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper introduces SOCIA (Simulation Orchestration for Cyber-physical-social Intelligence and Agents), a novel end-to-end framework leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems to automate the generation of high-fidelity Cyber-Physical-Social (CPS) simulators. Addressing the challenges of labor-intensive manual simulator development and complex data calibration, SOCIA integrates a centralized orchestration manager that coordinates specialized agents for tasks including data comprehension, code generation, simulation execution, and iterative evaluation-feedback loops. Through empirical evaluations across diverse CPS tasks, such as mask adoption behavior simulation (social), personal mobility generation (physical), and user modeling (cyber), SOCIA demonstrates its ability to produce high-fidelity, scalable simulations with reduced human intervention.

    <div class="abstract">LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model (ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end, we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation, we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence) self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</div>

    <h3>Are Large Language Models Reliable AI Scientists? Assessing   Reverse-Engineering of Black-Box Systems</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Using AI to create autonomous researchers has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery. A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well an AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from its behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM) learns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively collected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs across three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent different problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have considerable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through extensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from observations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of Bayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only observe but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific inputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs to test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data from one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of engaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling results in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that engaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes: overcomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the black-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations. These insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively reverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new discoveries.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite the importance of aligning language models with human preferences, crowd-sourced human feedback is often noisy -- for example, preferring less desirable responses -- posing a fundamental challenge to alignment. A truly robust alignment objective should yield identical model parameters even under severe label noise, a property known as redescending. We prove that no existing alignment methods satisfy this property. To address this, we propose H\"older-DPO, the first principled alignment loss with a provable redescending property, enabling estimation of the clean data distribution from noisy feedback. The aligned model estimates the likelihood of clean data, providing a theoretically grounded metric for dataset valuation that identifies the location and fraction of mislabels. This metric is gradient-free, enabling scalable and automated human feedback valuation without costly manual verification or clean validation dataset. H\"older-DPO achieves state-of-the-art robust alignment performance while accurately detecting mislabels in controlled datasets. Finally, we apply H\"older-DPO to widely used alignment datasets, revealing substantial noise levels and demonstrating that removing these mislabels significantly improves alignment performance across methods.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking" chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers - up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question. Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33% wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short, long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer "thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can, counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large-language-model (LLM) agents excel at reactive dialogue but struggle with proactive, goal-driven interactions due to myopic decoding and costly planning. We introduce DialogXpert, which leverages a frozen LLM to propose a small, high-quality set of candidate actions per turn and employs a compact Q-network over fixed BERT embeddings trained via temporal-difference learning to select optimal moves within this reduced space. By tracking the user's emotions, DialogXpert tailors each decision to advance the task while nurturing a genuine, empathetic connection. Across negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring benchmarks, DialogXpert drives conversations to under $3$ turns with success rates exceeding 94\% and, with a larger LLM prior, pushes success above 97\% while markedly improving negotiation outcomes. This framework delivers real-time, strategic, and emotionally intelligent dialogue planning at scale. Code available at https://github.com/declare-lab/dialogxpert/</div>

    <h3>Towards General Continuous Memory for Vision-Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs), have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential. Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this, we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Requirements elicitation and specification remains a labor-intensive, manual process prone to inconsistencies and gaps, presenting a significant challenge in modern software engineering. Emerging studies underscore the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for automated requirements generation to support requirements elicitation and specification; however, it remains unclear how to implement this effectively. In this work, we introduce ReqBrain, an Al-assisted tool that employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate authentic and adequate software requirements. Software engineers can engage with ReqBrain through chat-based sessions to automatically generate software requirements and categorize them by type. We curated a high-quality dataset of ISO 29148-compliant requirements and fine-tuned five 7B-parameter LLMs to determine the most effective base model for ReqBrain. The top-performing model, Zephyr-7b-beta, achieved 89.30\% Fl using the BERT score and a FRUGAL score of 91.20 in generating authentic and adequate requirements. Human evaluations further confirmed ReqBrain's effectiveness in generating requirements. Our findings suggest that generative Al, when fine-tuned, has the potential to improve requirements elicitation and specification, paving the way for future extensions into areas such as defect identification, test case generation, and agile user story creation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with needle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has received little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how variations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context question answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity, posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered, fine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three diverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures. Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware LLM-driven systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in understanding and generating semantic patterns, making them promising candidates for sequential recommendation tasks. However, when combined with conventional recommendation models (CRMs), LLMs often face challenges related to high inference costs and static knowledge transfer methods. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual distillation framework, LLMD4Rec, that fosters dynamic and bidirectional knowledge exchange between LLM-centric and CRM-based recommendation systems. Unlike traditional unidirectional distillation methods, LLMD4Rec enables iterative optimization by alternately refining both models, enhancing the semantic understanding of CRMs and enriching LLMs with collaborative signals from user-item interactions. By leveraging sample-wise adaptive weighting and aligning output distributions, our approach eliminates the need for additional parameters while ensuring effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMD4Rec significantly improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmarks without increasing inference costs. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for combining the strengths of both LLMs and CRMs in sequential recommendation systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score: 29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1 score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph, systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26 (over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Like any other discipline, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted software engineering by helping developers generate the required artifacts across various phases of software development. This paper presents a case study comparing the performance of popular LLMs GPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek in generating functional specifications that include use cases, business rules, and collaborative workflows for a web application, the Mess Management System. The study evaluated the quality of LLM generated use cases, business rules, and collaborative workflows in terms of their syntactic and semantic correctness, consistency, non ambiguity, and completeness compared to the reference specifications against the zero-shot prompted problem statement. Our results suggested that all four LLMs can specify syntactically and semantically correct, mostly non-ambiguous artifacts. Still, they may be inconsistent at times and may differ significantly in the completeness of the generated specification. Claude and Gemini generated all the reference use cases, with Claude achieving the most complete but somewhat redundant use case specifications. Similar results were obtained for specifying workflows. However, all four LLMs struggled to generate relevant Business Rules, with DeepSeek generating the most reference rules but with less completeness. Overall, Claude generated more complete specification artifacts, while Gemini was more precise in the specifications it generated.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). However, applying SVD-based procedures individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple two-step procedure to approximate SVD-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces. First, we construct a complete orthogonal basis using predefined orthogonal matrices of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Second, we adaptively select basis columns based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. Each projection matrix in our method is obtained via a single matrix multiplication followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. During training, we store only the indices of the selected columns, avoiding the need to store full projection matrices for each layer. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, matching the performance of costly SVD-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage. Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks: ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1. ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page: https://github.com/LitaoGuo/ComfyMind</div>

    <div class="abstract">Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery, particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking, relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.</div>

    <h3>COUNTDOWN: Contextually Sparse Activation Filtering Out Unnecessary   Weights in Down Projection</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.</div>

    <h3>Tuning Language Models for Robust Prediction of Diverse User Behaviors</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Predicting user behavior is essential for intelligent assistant services, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-tailed behaviors. Large language models (LLMs), with their pretraining on vast corpora containing rich behavioral knowledge, offer promise. However, existing fine-tuning approaches tend to overfit to frequent ``anchor'' behaviors, reducing their ability to predict less common ``tail'' behaviors. In this paper, we introduce BehaviorLM, a progressive fine-tuning approach that addresses this issue. In the first stage, LLMs are fine-tuned on anchor behaviors while preserving general behavioral knowledge. In the second stage, fine-tuning uses a balanced subset of all behaviors based on sample difficulty to improve tail behavior predictions without sacrificing anchor performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaviorLM robustly predicts both anchor and tail behaviors and effectively leverages LLM behavioral knowledge to master tail behavior prediction with few-shot examples.</div>
