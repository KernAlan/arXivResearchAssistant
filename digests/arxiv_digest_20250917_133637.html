    <div class="abstract">Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines such as Expel.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut, SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses: Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX) continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches, Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription, intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval, dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple deployments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks, they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in practical settings.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of performance.</div>

    <h3>RAGs to Riches: RAG-like Few-shot Learning for Large Language Model   Role-playing</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.</div>

    <h3>Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise   Behaviors</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the \textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This work introduces xOffense, an AI-driven, multi-agent penetration testing framework that shifts the process from labor-intensive, expert-driven manual efforts to fully automated, machine-executable workflows capable of scaling seamlessly with computational infrastructure. At its core, xOffense leverages a fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT. These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior, cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP, with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more research in the low-compute regime.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces (Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users. This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm (Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification.

    <div class="abstract">Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50). Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment, sequential planning, and execution.</div>

    <h3>InfoGain-RAG: Boosting Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Document   Information Gain-based Reranking and Filtering</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination, outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented. Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple applications.</div>

    <h3>Zero-shot Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework with LLMs</h3>

    <div class="abstract">We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow, while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably, GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.</div>

    <h3>Instance-level Randomization: Toward More Stable LLM Evaluations</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR) method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance, run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.</div>
