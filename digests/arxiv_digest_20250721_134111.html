    <div class="abstract">Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities, and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study, several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions. Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability, yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching, outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology matching at scale.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing. The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion, environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference speed.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment.

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we present AIvaluateXR, a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking LLMs running on XR devices. To demonstrate the framework, we deploy 17 selected LLMs across four XR platforms: Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct an extensive evaluation. Our experimental setup measures four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified evaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based setups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our findings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

    <h3>Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph   is What We Need</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.</div>

    <h3>LoopServe: An Adaptive Dual-phase LLM Inference Acceleration System for   Multi-Turn Dialogues</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of machine-generated texts.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration. Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation.

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect, iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional, and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns, incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at https://github.com/mmiroyan/ParaStudent.</div>

    <div class="abstract">When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language; (ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Software engineers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process, especially in the age of large language models (LLMs) that can automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.</div>

    <h3>ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of   RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</div>
