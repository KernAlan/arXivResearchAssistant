    <div class="abstract">In this paper, we introduce CIBER (Claim Investigation Based on Evidence Retrieval), an extension of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to identify corroborating and refuting documents as evidence for scientific claim verification. CIBER addresses the inherent uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) by evaluating response consistency across diverse interrogation probes. By focusing on the behavioral analysis of LLMs without requiring access to their internal information, CIBER is applicable to both white-box and black-box models. Furthermore, CIBER operates in an unsupervised manner, enabling easy generalization across various scientific domains. Comprehensive evaluations conducted using LLMs with varying levels of linguistic proficiency reveal CIBER's superior performance compared to conventional RAG approaches. These findings not only highlight the effectiveness of CIBER but also provide valuable insights for future advancements in LLM-based scientific claim verification.</div>

    <h3>Dynamic Path Navigation for Motion Agents with LLM Reasoning</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalizable reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their efficacies in spatial path planning and obstacle-free trajectory generation remain underexplored. Leveraging LLMs for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner, modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-step planning or local policies, our training-free LLM-based method enables global, dynamic, closed-loop planning, and autonomously resolving collision issues.</div>

The framework automates tasks such as entity extraction, relationship inference, and semantic enrichment, enabling advanced querying, reasoning, and analytics across data types like emails, calendars, chats, documents, and logs. Designed for enterprise flexibility, it supports applications such as contextual search, task prioritization, expertise discovery, personalized recommendations, and advanced analytics to identify trends and actionable insights. Experimental results demonstrate its success in the discovery of expertise, task management, and data-driven decision making.

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, yet still produce errors in domain-specific tasks. To further improve their performance, we propose KSOD (Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to improve their capabilities with knowledge-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT). KSOD analyzes the causes of errors from the perspective of knowledge deficiency by identifying potential missing knowledge in LLM that may lead to the errors. Subsequently, KSOD tunes a knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the identified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD supplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module. Tuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and knowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four general benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance of LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their performance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of improving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The impact of random seeds in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has been largely overlooked despite its potential influence on model performance.In this study, we systematically evaluate the effects of random seeds on LLMs using the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We analyze the macro-level impact through traditional metrics like accuracy and F1, calculating their mean and variance to quantify performance fluctuations. To capture the micro-level effects, we introduce a novel metric, consistency, measuring the stability of individual predictions across runs. Our experiments reveal significant variance at both macro and micro levels, underscoring the need for careful consideration of random seeds in fine-tuning and evaluation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Developing autonomous home robots controlled by natural language has long been a pursuit of human. While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), which requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect EMMOE-100, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design HomieBot, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate HomieBot's performance and the evaluation of different models and policies.</div>

    <h3>Reasoning and Sampling-Augmented MCQ Difficulty Prediction via LLMs</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 8/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">The difficulty of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) is a crucial factor for educational assessments. Predicting MCQ difficulty is challenging since it requires understanding both the complexity of reaching the correct option and the plausibility of distractors, i.e., incorrect options. In this paper, we propose a novel, two-stage method to predict the difficulty of MCQs. First, to better estimate the complexity of each MCQ, we use large language models (LLMs) to augment the reasoning steps required to reach each option. We use not just the MCQ itself but also these reasoning steps as input to predict the difficulty. Second, to capture the plausibility of distractors, we sample knowledge levels from a distribution to account for variation among students responding to the MCQ. This setup, inspired by item response theory (IRT), enable us to estimate the likelihood of students selecting each (both correct and incorrect) option. We align these predictions with their ground truth values, using a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization objective, and use estimated likelihoods to predict MCQ difficulty. We evaluate our method on two real-world \emph{math} MCQ and response datasets with ground truth difficulty values estimated using IRT. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all baselines, up to a 28.3\% reduction in mean squared error and a 34.6\% improvement in the coefficient of determination. We also qualitatively discuss how our novel method results in higher accuracy in predicting MCQ difficulty.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While machine learning algorithms have been shown to excel at specific chemical tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning, limiting their widespread adoption. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful chemical reasoning engines when integrated with traditional search algorithms, enabling a new approach to computer-aided chemistry that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our method allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language to find routes that satisfy these constraints in vast searches. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. Our approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical reasoning systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets. V-Max integrates a set of observation and reward functions, transformer-based encoders, and training pipelines. Additionally, it includes adversarial evaluation settings and an extensive set of evaluation metrics. Through a large-scale benchmark, we analyze how network architectures, observation functions, training data, and reward shaping impact RL performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in tasks like visual question answering (VQA) but still face challenges in multimodal reasoning. Recent works adapt agentic frameworks or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. However, CoT-based multimodal reasoning often demands costly data annotation and fine-tuning, while agentic approaches relying on external tools risk introducing unreliable output from these tools. In this paper, we propose Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence (SRICE), a training-free multimodal reasoning framework that integrates external vision models with uncertainty quantification (UQ) into an MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, SRICE guides the inference process by allowing MLLM to autonomously select regions of interest through multi-stage interactions with the help of external tools. We propose to use a conformal prediction-based approach to calibrate the output of external tools and select the optimal tool by estimating the uncertainty of an MLLM's output. Our experiment shows that the average improvement of SRICE over the base MLLM is 4.6% on five datasets and the performance on some datasets even outperforms fine-tuning-based methods, revealing the significance of ensuring reliable tool use in an MLLM agent.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The emergence of large language models (LLMs) opens new frontiers for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), yet existing systems remain confined to predefined tasks due to hardware-software co-design challenges. This paper presents the first aerial intelligent agent capable of open-world task execution through tight integration of LLM-based reasoning and robotic autonomy. Our hardware-software co-designed system addresses two fundamental limitations: (1) Onboard LLM operation via an edge-optimized computing platform, achieving 5-6 tokens/sec inference for 14B-parameter models at 220W peak power; (2) A bidirectional cognitive architecture that synergizes slow deliberative planning (LLM task planning) with fast reactive control (state estimation, mapping, obstacle avoidance, and motion planning). Validated through preliminary results using our prototype, the system demonstrates reliable task planning and scene understanding in communication-constrained environments, such as sugarcane monitoring, power grid inspection, mine tunnel exploration, and biological observation applications. This work establishes a novel framework for embodied aerial artificial intelligence, bridging the gap between task planning and robotic autonomy in open environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Long-form writing agents require flexible integration and interaction across information retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Current approaches rely on predetermined workflows and rigid thinking patterns to generate outlines before writing, resulting in constrained adaptability during writing. In this paper we propose a general agent framework that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types, i.e. retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Our methodology features: 1) a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution, eliminating artificial restrictions on writing workflow; and 2) integration of task types that facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition. Evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all automatic evaluation metrics, which demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed framework.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this paper, I present our work on DeepRAG, a specialized embedding model we built specifically for Hindi language in RAG systems. While LLMs have gotten really good at generating text, their performance in retrieval tasks still depends heavily on having quality embeddings - something that's been lacking for Hindi despite being one of the world's most spoken languages. We tackled this by creating embeddings from the ground up rather than just fine-tuning existing models. Our process involved collecting diverse Hindi texts (over 2.7M samples), training a custom SentencePiece tokenizer that actually understands Hindi morphology, designing transformer architecture with Hindi-specific attention mechanisms, and optimizing with contrastive learning. Results were honestly better than I expected - we saw a 23% improvement in retrieval precision compared to the multilingual models everyone's been using. The paper details our methodology, which I think could help others working with low-resource languages where the one-size-fits-all multilingual models fall short. We've also integrated our embeddings with LangChain to build complete Hindi RAG systems, which might be useful for practitioners. While there's still tons more to explore, I believe this work addresses a critical gap for Hindi NLP and demonstrates why language-specific approaches matter.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Human interaction with the external world fundamentally involves the exchange of personal memory, whether with other individuals, websites, applications, or, in the future, AI agents. A significant portion of this interaction is redundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across different contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials, autofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate this redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly used user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND ME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that retains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By serving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate context-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and interaction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME extends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory parameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning, and adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and intelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like SECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME further represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction with persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems. We have open-sourced the fully localizable deployment system at GitHub: https://github.com/Mindverse/Second-Me.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Explainable recommendation systems leverage transparent reasoning to foster user trust and improve decision-making processes. Current approaches typically decouple recommendation generation from explanation creation, violating causal precedence principles where explanatory factors should logically precede outcomes. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating structural causal models with large language models to establish causal consistency in recommendation pipelines. Our methodology enforces explanation factors as causal antecedents to recommendation predictions through causal graph construction and counterfactual adjustment. We particularly address the confounding effect of item popularity that distorts personalization signals in explanations, developing a debiasing mechanism that disentangles genuine user preferences from conformity bias. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that CausalX achieves superior performance in recommendation accuracy, explanation plausibility, and bias mitigation compared to baselines.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in open-ended dialogue, yet their inability to retain and retrieve relevant information from long-term interactions limits their effectiveness in applications requiring sustained personalization. External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse, complex tasks. However, extensive token counts lead to high computational and financial burdens. To address this, we propose Efficient and Flexible Prompt Compression (EFPC), a novel method unifying task-aware and task-agnostic compression for a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EFPC uses GPT-4 to generate compressed prompts and integrates them with original prompts for training. During training and inference, we selectively prepend user instructions and compress prompts based on predicted probabilities. EFPC is highly data-efficient, achieving significant performance with minimal data. Compared to the state-of-the-art method LLMLingua-2, EFPC achieves a 4.8% relative improvement in F1-score with 1% additional data at a 4x compression rate, and an 11.4% gain with 10% additional data on the LongBench single-doc QA benchmark. EFPC's unified framework supports broad applicability and enhances performance across various models, tasks, and domains, offering a practical advancement in NLP.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this report, we introduce Gemini Embedding, a state-of-the-art embedding model leveraging the power of Gemini, Google's most capable large language model. Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.</div>

    <h3>Safety Guardrails for LLM-Enabled Robots</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety concerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to adversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in real-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the novel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the physical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure the safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined safety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust LLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety specifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves potential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a possibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures safety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking attacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans from 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also demonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive attacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to perform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to mitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various contexts, yet remain prone to generating non-factual content, commonly referred to as "hallucinations". The literature categorizes hallucinations into several types, including entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. However, existing hallucination datasets often fail to capture fine-grained hallucinations in multilingual settings. In this work, we introduce HalluVerse25, a multilingual LLM hallucination dataset that categorizes fine-grained hallucinations in English, Arabic, and Turkish. Our dataset construction pipeline uses an LLM to inject hallucinations into factual biographical sentences, followed by a rigorous human annotation process to ensure data quality. We evaluate several LLMs on HalluVerse25, providing valuable insights into how proprietary models perform in detecting LLM-generated hallucinations across different contexts.</div>
