        <h3>ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights</h3>
        Hey boss, found 2 cool papers today that I think you'll love:
<ol>
<li><strong>ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control</strong> â€” Researchers behind ReCode (arXiv, avg score 8.5/10; Relevance 9/10, Importance 8/10) propose Recursive Code Generation, a single code representation that treats high-level plans as placeholder functions and recursively decomposes them into finer sub-functions so the agent fluidly controls decision granularity. For us that means a practical path to replace brittle plan-vs-action pipelines with a single recursive-decomposition executor (code at http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23564v1) â€” next step: try a small prototype applying ReCode-style recursion to one of our multi-step workflows to see if inference accuracy and training data efficiency improve. 
<li><strong>ALITA-G: Self-Evolving Generative Agent for Agent Generation</strong> â€” The ALITA-G team (avg score 8.0/10; Relevance 9/10, Importance 7/10) introduce a self-evolution loop that extracts, abstracts, and curates Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools from successful runs to turn a generalist agent into reusable domain experts, improving accuracy while cutting compute (e.g., SOTA on GAIA with 83.03% pass@1 and ~15% fewer tokens). This maps directly to a production pattern: instrument a generalist agent on target-domain tasks, auto-synthesize and store MCPs, then use retrieval-augmented MCP selection at inference (see http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23601v1) â€” next step: run ALITA-Gâ€™s MCP extraction on a single domain we care about and measure token and accuracy gains.
</ol>
Letâ€™s prototype ReCodeâ€™s recursive decomposition on one pipeline and run a small ALITA-G MCP extraction experiment this week to get concrete numbers.

    <div class="abstract">Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.</div>

    <h3>Alita-G: Self-Evolving Generative Agent for Agent Generation</h3>
    <div class="scores">
        <span class="score relevance">Relevance: 9/10</span>
        <span class="score importance">Importance: 7/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.</div>
