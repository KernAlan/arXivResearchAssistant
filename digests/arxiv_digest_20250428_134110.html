    <div class="abstract">Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (BackSlash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). BackSlash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that BackSlash can reduce memory usage by 60% - 90% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, BackSlash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.</div>

    <h3>HALO: Hardware-aware quantization with low critical-path-delay weights   for LLM acceleration</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Quantization is critical for efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs). Yet conventional methods remain hardware-agnostic, limited to bit-width constraints, and do not account for intrinsic circuit characteristics such as the timing behaviors and energy profiles of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units. This disconnect from circuit-level behavior limits the ability to exploit available timing margins and energy-saving opportunities, reducing the overall efficiency of deployment on modern accelerators.   To address these limitations, we propose HALO, a versatile framework for Hardware-Aware Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). Unlike traditional methods, HALO explicitly incorporates detailed hardware characteristics, including critical-path timing and power consumption, into its quantization approach. HALO strategically selects weights with low critical-path-delays enabling higher operational frequencies and dynamic frequency scaling without disrupting the architecture's dataflow. Remarkably, HALO achieves these improvements with only a few dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) adjustments, ensuring simplicity and practicality in deployment. Additionally, by reducing switching activity within the MAC units, HALO effectively lowers energy consumption. Evaluations on accelerators such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) demonstrate that HALO significantly enhances inference efficiency, achieving average performance improvements of 270% and energy savings of 51% over baseline quantization methods, all with minimal impact on accuracy.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Accurate wave height prediction is critical for maritime safety and coastal resilience, yet conventional physics-based models and traditional machine learning methods face challenges in computational efficiency and nonlinear dynamics modeling. This study introduces Chronos, the first implementation of a large language model (LLM)-powered temporal architecture (Chronos) optimized for wave forecasting. Through advanced temporal pattern recognition applied to historical wave data from three strategically chosen marine zones in the Northwest Pacific basin, our framework achieves multimodal improvements: (1) 14.3% reduction in training time with 2.5x faster inference speed compared to PatchTST baselines, achieving 0.575 mean absolute scaled error (MASE) units; (2) superior short-term forecasting (1-24h) across comprehensive metrics; (3) sustained predictive leadership in extended-range forecasts (1-120h); and (4) demonstrated zero-shot capability maintaining median performance (rank 4/12) against specialized operational models. This LLM-enhanced temporal modeling paradigm establishes a new standard in wave prediction, offering both computationally efficient solutions and a transferable framework for complex geophysical systems modeling.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have revealed an \textit{overthinking} phenomenon, where models generate verbose reasoning across all tasks regardless of questions. To address this issue, we present \textbf{FAST}, a novel \textbf{Fa}st-\textbf{S}low \textbf{T}hinking framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics. Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect performance. We develop FAST-GRPO with three components: model-based metrics for question characterization, an adaptive thinking reward mechanism, and difficulty-aware KL regularization. Experiments across seven reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over 10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively balancing reasoning length and accuracy.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various sectors, cyber security continues to rely on traditional static and dynamic analysis tools, hampered by high false positive rates and superficial code comprehension. While generative AI offers promising automation capabilities for software development, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection presents unique challenges. This paper explores the potential and limitations of LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities, acknowledging inherent weaknesses such as hallucinations, limited context length, and knowledge cut-offs. Previous attempts employing machine learning models for vulnerability detection have proven ineffective due to limited real-world applicability, feature engineering challenges, lack of contextual understanding, and the complexities of training models to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. Therefore, we propose a robust AI-driven approach focused on mitigating these limitations and ensuring the quality and reliability of LLM based vulnerability detection. Through innovative methodologies combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Mixtureof-Agents (MoA), this research seeks to leverage the strengths of LLMs while addressing their weaknesses, ultimately paving the way for dependable and efficient AI-powered solutions in securing the ever-evolving software landscape.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Generative AI (GenAI) applications are transforming software engineering by enabling automated code co-creation. However, empirical evidence on GenAI's productivity effects in industrial settings remains limited. This paper investigates the adoption of GenAI coding assistants (e.g., Codeium, Amazon Q) within telecommunications and FinTech domains. Through surveys and interviews with industrial domain-experts, we identify primary productivity-influencing factors, including task complexity, coding skills, domain knowledge, and GenAI integration. Our findings indicate that GenAI tools enhance productivity in routine coding tasks (e.g., refactoring and Javadoc generation) but face challenges in complex, domain-specific activities due to limited context-awareness of codebases and insufficient support for customized design rules. We highlight new paradigms for coding transfer, emphasizing iterative prompt refinement, immersive development environment, and automated code evaluation as essential for effective GenAI usage.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on multi-turn reasoning datasets.</div>

We validate the effectiveness of PerfCam through a practical deployment within realistic test production lines in the pharmaceutical industry and contribute an openly published dataset to support further research and development in the field. The results demonstrate PerfCam's ability to deliver actionable insights through its precise digital twin capabilities, underscoring its value as an effective tool for developing usable digital twins in smart manufacturing environments and extracting operational analytics.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In response to the growing problem of misinformation in the context of globalization and informatization, this paper proposes a classification method for fact-check-worthiness estimation based on prompt tuning. We construct a model for fact-check-worthiness estimation at the methodological level using prompt tuning. By applying designed prompt templates to large language models, we establish in-context learning and leverage prompt tuning technology to improve the accuracy of determining whether claims have fact-check-worthiness, particularly when dealing with limited or unlabeled data. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses or matches multiple baseline methods in the classification task of fact-check-worthiness estimation assessment, including classical pre-trained models such as BERT, as well as recent popular large models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Experiments show that the prompt tuning-based method proposed in this study exhibits certain advantages in evaluation metrics such as F1 score and accuracy, thereby effectively validating its effectiveness and advancement in the task of fact-check-worthiness estimation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first, Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent Computer-Using Agents (CUAs), powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), offer a promising direction for automating complex desktop workflows through natural language. However, most existing CUAs remain conceptual prototypes, hindered by shallow OS integration, fragile screenshot-based interaction, and disruptive execution.   We present UFO2, a multiagent AgentOS for Windows desktops that elevates CUAs into practical, system-level automation. UFO2 features a centralized HostAgent for task decomposition and coordination, alongside a collection of application-specialized AppAgent equipped with native APIs, domain-specific knowledge, and a unified GUI--API action layer. This architecture enables robust task execution while preserving modularity and extensibility. A hybrid control detection pipeline fuses Windows UI Automation (UIA) with vision-based parsing to support diverse interface styles. Runtime efficiency is further enhanced through speculative multi-action planning, reducing per-step LLM overhead. Finally, a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) interface enables automation within an isolated virtual desktop, allowing agents and users to operate concurrently without interference.   We evaluate UFO2 across over 20 real-world Windows applications, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and execution accuracy over prior CUAs. Our results show that deep OS integration unlocks a scalable path toward reliable, user-aligned desktop automation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.</div>

    <div class="abstract">To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process inputs and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors influencing the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.</div>

    <h3>ElChat: Adapting Chat Language Models Using Only Target Unlabeled   Language Data</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Vocabulary expansion (VE) is the de-facto approach to language adaptation of large language models (LLMs) by adding new tokens and continuing pre-training on target data. While this is effective for base models trained on unlabeled data, it poses challenges for chat models trained to follow instructions through labeled conversation data. Directly adapting the latter with VE on target unlabeled data may result in forgetting chat abilities. While ideal, target chat data is often unavailable or costly to create for low-resource languages, and machine-translated alternatives are not always effective. To address this issue, previous work proposed using a base and chat model from the same family. This method first adapts the base LLM with VE on target unlabeled data and then converts it to a chat model by adding a chat vector (CV) derived from the weight difference between the source base and chat models. We propose ElChat, a new language adaptation method for chat LLMs that adapts a chat model directly on target unlabeled data, without a base model. It elicits chat abilities by injecting information from the source chat model. ElChat offers more robust and competitive target language and safety performance while achieving superior English, chat, and instruction-following abilities compared to CV.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.</div>
