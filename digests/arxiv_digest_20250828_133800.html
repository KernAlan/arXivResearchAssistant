    <div class="abstract">Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is a GPU-intensive task where traditional autoscalers fall short, particularly for modern Prefill-Decode (P/D) disaggregated architectures. This architectural shift, while powerful, introduces significant operational challenges, including inefficient use of heterogeneous hardware, network bottlenecks, and critical imbalances between prefill and decode stages. We introduce HeteroScale, a coordinated autoscaling framework that addresses the core challenges of P/D disaggregated serving. HeteroScale combines a topology-aware scheduler that adapts to heterogeneous hardware and network constraints with a novel metric-driven policy derived from the first large-scale empirical study of autoscaling signals in production. By leveraging a single, robust metric to jointly scale prefill and decode pools, HeteroScale maintains architectural balance while ensuring efficient, adaptive resource management. Deployed in a massive production environment on tens of thousands of GPUs, HeteroScale has proven its effectiveness, increasing average GPU utilization by a significant 26.6 percentage points and saving hundreds of thousands of GPU-hours daily, all while upholding stringent service level objectives.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.</div>

    <h3>Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization Integrating TextGrad-style Prompt   Optimization with Memory-Driven Self-Evolution</h3>
    <div class="scores">

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the immediate task context.   To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module - structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer, implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies. This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.   We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode - without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.</div>

    <h3>LFD: Layer Fused Decoding to Exploit External Knowledge in   Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce HAMLET, a holistic and automated framework for evaluating the long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). HAMLET structures source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across model scales. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/HAMLET.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Context is critical for meaningful interactions between people and Generative AI (GenAI). Yet mainstream tools offer limited means to orchestrate it, particularly across workflows that span multiple interactions, sessions, and models, as often occurs in creative projects. Re specifying prior details, juggling diverse artifacts, and dealing with context drift overwhelm users, obscure intent, and curtail creativity. To address these challenges, we present Orchid, a system that gives its users affordances to specify, reference, and monitor context throughout evolving workflows. Specifically, Orchid enables users to (1) specify context related to the project, themselves, and different styles, (2) reference these via explicit mentions, inline selection, or implicit grounding, and (3) monitor context assigned to different interactions across the workflow. In a within-subjects study (n=12), participants using Orchid to execute creative tasks (compared to a baseline toolkit of web search, LLM-based chat, and digital notebooks) produced more novel and feasible outcomes, reporting greater alignment between their intent and the AI's responses, higher perceived control, and increased transparency. By prioritizing context orchestration, Orchid offers an actionable step toward next generation GenAI tools that support complex, iterative workflows - enabling creators and AI to stay aligned and augment their creative potential.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots, and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however, attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM. Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication (MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800, APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup over CUTLASS integer baselines.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations.

    <div class="abstract">Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits, hardware engineers are required to devote more effort to the full design-to-manufacturing workflow. This workflow involves numerous iterations, making it both labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for more efficient Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in contextual comprehension, logical reasoning, and generative capabilities. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be represented as text, integrating LLM for EDA offers a promising opportunity to simplify and even automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of incorporating LLMs into EDA, with emphasis on their capabilities, limitations, and future opportunities. Three case studies, along with their outlook, are introduced to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in hardware design, testing, and optimization. Finally, future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA, providing valuable insights for researchers interested in leveraging advanced AI technologies for EDA.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid adoption of LLM-based conversational systems is already transforming the landscape of educational technology. However, the current state-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's affective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim that positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware LLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student conversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from the conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's emotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM Tutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our model using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions and user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win rate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly supports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by modeling students' emotions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The proliferation of digital payment platforms has transformed commerce, offering unmatched convenience and accessibility globally. However, this growth has also attracted malicious actors, leading to a corresponding increase in sophisticated social engineering scams. These scams are often initiated and orchestrated on multiple surfaces outside the payment platform, making user and transaction-based signals insufficient for a complete understanding of the scam's methodology and underlying patterns, without which it is very difficult to prevent it in a timely manner. This paper presents CASE (Conversational Agent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this problem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable manner. A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview potential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed conversation. The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI system that extracts information and converts it into structured data for downstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's Gemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay) India. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have observed a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements. The architecture and its robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint for building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence in other sensitive domains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid conclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is under-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.</div>

    <h3>Safety Alignment Should Be Made More Than Just A Few Attention Heads</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Current safety alignment for large language models(LLMs) continues to present vulnerabilities, given that adversarial prompting can effectively bypass their safety measures.Our investigation shows that these safety mechanisms predominantly depend on a limited subset of attention heads: removing or ablating these heads can severely compromise model safety. To identify and evaluate these safety-critical components, we introduce RDSHA, a targeted ablation method that leverages the model's refusal direction to pinpoint attention heads mostly responsible for safety behaviors. Further analysis shows that existing jailbreak attacks exploit this concentration by selectively bypassing or manipulating these critical attention heads. To address this issue, we propose AHD, a novel training strategy designed to promote the distributed encoding of safety-related behaviors across numerous attention heads. Experimental results demonstrate that AHD successfully distributes safety-related capabilities across more attention heads. Moreover, evaluations under several mainstream jailbreak attacks show that models trained with AHD exhibit considerably stronger safety robustness, while maintaining overall functional utility.</div>

    <div class="abstract">\Abstract{In the realm of education, student evaluation holds equal significance as imparting knowledge. To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.}</div>

    <h3>Reliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents</h3>

    <div class="abstract">We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further research.</div>
