        <h3>ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights</h3>
        Hey boss! I came across 5 super interesting papers today that I think you'll find really relevant:

<ol>
<li><strong>VitaBench:</strong> This Stanford team created a new benchmark for LLM agents that simulates real-world tasks like food delivery and travel services. Itâ€™s designed to push agents to their limits by using a mix of 66 tools and 300 diverse tasks. The takeaway? Even the best models are only nailing 30-50% success rates, which means there's a lot of room for improvement in developing practical AI agents. This could be a game changer for real-world AI applications!</li>

<li><strong>Unbiased Collective Memory for 6G:</strong> Researchers introduced a framework for managing resources in 6G networks using LLMs. Their system helps agents learn from past negotiations (both successes and failures) to avoid biases that usually mess things up. The result? They saw a 4.5x reduction in unresolved negotiations, which could seriously boost network efficiency and reliability!</li>

<li><strong>SafeEvalAgent:</strong> This paper tackles the need for ongoing safety evaluations of LLMs, especially in high-stakes areas. The authors propose a multi-agent framework that continuously evolves its safety benchmarks based on new findings. This could help us spot vulnerabilities that traditional static assessments miss, ensuring safer AI deployment. Super relevant for compliance and risk management!</li>

<li><strong>Learning to See Before Seeing:</strong> This study dives into how LLMs develop visual priors just from language training. They found that these models can perform visual tasks with minimal visual data, thanks to implicit knowledge gained during training. This opens up new possibilities for creating multimodal LLMs that are better at understanding and interacting with the visual world!</li>

<li><strong>SCUBA:</strong> This benchmark evaluates agents on CRM workflows specifically for Salesforce. It highlights significant performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models in real-world tasks. The findings emphasize how challenging enterprise task automation can be, but also show that thereâ€™s potential for building effective agent solutions that can save time and costs.</li>

    <div class="abstract">As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios, existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications.

    <h3>Toward an Unbiased Collective Memory for Efficient LLM-Based Agentic 6G   Cross-Domain Management</h3>

    <div class="abstract">This paper introduces a novel framework for proactive cross-domain resource orchestration in 6G RAN-Edge networks, featuring large language model (LLM)-augmented agents. The system comprises specialized RAN (energy efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases -- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i) semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii) diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies, either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines, respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving latency and energy saving distributions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However, existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of advanced AI.</div>

    <h3>Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from   Language Pre-training</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone, surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews, spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation, data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting, open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA, while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and 16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents.

    <h3>R-Log: Incentivizing Log Analysis Capability in LLMs via Reasoning-based   Reinforcement Learning</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13 strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function. Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by 228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the efficacy.</div>

    <h3>Accelerating LLM Inference with Precomputed Query Storage</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high latency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as on-device or edge deployments. To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast, similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type, we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage. This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than \$13 million annual cost.</div>

    <h3>TruthRL: Incentivizing Truthful LLMs via Reinforcement Learning</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 9/10</span>
    </div>
    <div class="abstract">While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs) promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over 85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy (F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and reliability in high-stakes scientific applications.

    <h3>Fairness Testing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: How Small   Perturbations Reveal Bias in Small Language Models</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability.</div>

    <h3>SeedPrints: Fingerprints Can Even Tell Which Seed Your Large Language   Model Was Trained From</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters -- properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training, enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications. Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.</div>

    <h3>Commmunication-Efficient and Accurate Approach for Aggregation in   Federated Low-Rank Adaptation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation (FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur \emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early \textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla \Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} = \hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication overhead.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term decision-making.</div>

    <h3>SlimPack: Fine-Grained Asymmetric Packing for Balanced and Efficient   Variable-Length LLM Training</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or communication efficiency.   To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high resource efficiency.</div>
