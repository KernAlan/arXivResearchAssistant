    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence, potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.   In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional'' software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven, scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify its outputs.   To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this paper.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.</div>

    <h3>Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute   Implementations</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction pipelines in resource-constrained environments.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of long-context performance degradation in realistic software development settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring, multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions, including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands more attention.

    <h3>Character-Level Perturbations Disrupt LLM Watermarks</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.   To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning. VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting, Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation, and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory, and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets, establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark, designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM, a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size, architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing valuable insights for developers aiming to build more sustainable AI systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.   Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.   Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp, while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

    <h3>ButterflyQuant: Ultra-low-bit LLM Quantization through Learnable   Orthogonal Butterfly Transforms</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.</div>

    <h3>Fluent but Unfeeling: The Emotional Blind Spots of Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research. While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories, enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples, limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs benchmarks with reasonable rationales.</div>
