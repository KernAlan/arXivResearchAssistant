    <div class="abstract">Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents, and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements, balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes. Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous data systems leveraging AI agents.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost. While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits, and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular, token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four synergistic mechanisms:   (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.   Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters. Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs. Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.</div>

    <h3>Advancing Jailbreak Strategies: A Hybrid Approach to Exploiting LLM   Vulnerabilities and Bypassing Modern Defenses</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications. Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks. Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis. We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL), highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation. These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by integrating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into models, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy while mitigating factual errors and hallucinations. This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components.

    <div class="abstract">Instruction tuning is a crucial step in improving the responsiveness of pretrained large language models (LLMs) to human instructions. Federated learning (FL) helps to exploit the use of vast private instruction data from clients, becoming popular for LLM tuning by improving data diversity. Existing federated tuning simply consumes all local data, causing excessive computational overhead and overfitting to local data, while centralized data-efficient solutions are not suitable for FL due to privacy concerns. This work presents FedHDS, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which tunes LLMs with a representative subset of edge-side data. It reduces the data redundancy at both intra- and inter-client levels without sharing raw data. Experiments with various LLMs, datasets and partitions show that FedHDS improves Rouge-L on unseen tasks by an average of 10.72% over the SOTA full-data federated instruction tuning methods, while using less than 1.5% of the data samples, improving training efficiency by up to tens of times.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.</div>

    <h3>Probabilistic Optimality for Inference-time Scaling</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop \textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.</div>

    <h3>Concept-Level AI for Telecom: Moving Beyond Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex, hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e., over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens, offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective AI-driven telecom management.</div>

    <h3>Visual Structures Helps Visual Reasoning: Addressing the Binding Problem   in VLMs</h3>

        <span class="score importance">Importance: 9/10</span>

    <div class="abstract">Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

    <div class="abstract">This paper introduces KunLunBaizeRAG, a reinforcement learning-driven reasoning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex multi-hop question-answering tasks. The framework addresses key limitations of traditional RAG, such as retrieval drift, information redundancy, and strategy rigidity. Key innovations include the RAG-driven Reasoning Alignment (RDRA) mechanism, the Search-Think Iterative Enhancement (STIE) mechanism, the Network-Local Intelligent Routing (NLR) mechanism, and a progressive hybrid training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in exact match (EM) and LLM-judged score (LJ) across four benchmarks, highlighting the framework's robustness and effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios.</div>

    <h3>The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of   Reason</h3>

    <div class="abstract">As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone, and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. A similar pattern is also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench-Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks. These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</div>

    <h3>Wider or Deeper? Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive   Branching Tree Search</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.</div>

    <h3>Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Shuffle Inconsistency</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance and have been put into practical use in commercial applications, but they still have potential safety mechanism vulnerabilities. Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has gained prominence through low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA. In this paper, we focus on sparsity-based PEFT (SPEFT), which introduces trainable sparse adaptations to the weight matrices in the model, offering greater flexibility in selecting fine-tuned parameters compared to low-rank methods. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance. Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs, providing a simple yet effective baseline for SPEFT. Our work challenges the notion that complexity is necessary for effective PEFT, while our open-source framework establishes a reproducible benchmark for future research, which is available at [https://github.com/0-ml/speft].</div>
