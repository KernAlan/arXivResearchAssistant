    <div class="abstract">Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing demand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks. To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.</div>

    <h3>A Measure Based Generalizable Approach to Understandability</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human. State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring non-trivial prompt engineering).   In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic research investigations in future.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL, driven by large language models, are democratizing data access. Despite these advancements, enterprise deployments remain challenging due to the need to capture business-specific knowledge, handle complex queries, and meet expectations of continuous improvements. To address these issues, we designed and implemented GenEdit: our Text-to-SQL generation system that improves with user feedback. GenEdit builds and maintains a company-specific knowledge set, employs a pipeline of operators decomposing SQL generation, and uses feedback to update its knowledge set to improve future SQL generations.   We describe GenEdit's architecture made of two core modules: (i) decomposed SQL generation; and (ii) knowledge set edits based on user feedback. For generation, GenEdit leverages compounding operators to improve knowledge retrieval and to create a plan as chain-of-thought steps that guides generation. GenEdit first retrieves relevant examples in an initial retrieval stage where original SQL queries are decomposed into sub-statements, clauses or sub-queries. It then also retrieves instructions and schema elements. Using the retrieved contextual information, GenEdit then generates step-by-step plan in natural language on how to produce the query. Finally, GenEdit uses the plan to generate SQL, minimizing the need for model reasoning, which enhances complex SQL generation. If necessary, GenEdit regenerates the query based on syntactic and semantic errors. The knowledge set edits are recommended through an interactive copilot, allowing users to iterate on their feedback and to regenerate SQL queries as needed. Each generation uses staged edits which update the generation prompt. Once the feedback is submitted, it gets merged after passing regression testing and obtaining an approval, improving future generations.</div>

    <h3>SWI: Speaking with Intent in Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we propose a metric called Number of Thoughts (NofT) to determine the difficulty of tasks pre-prompting and support Large Language Models (LLMs) in production contexts. By setting thresholds based on the number of thoughts, this metric can discern the difficulty of prompts and support more effective prompt routing. A 2% decrease in latency is achieved when routing prompts from the MathInstruct dataset through quantized, distilled versions of Deepseek with 1.7 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters. Moreover, this metric can be used to detect adversarial prompts used in prompt injection attacks with high efficacy. The Number of Thoughts can inform a classifier that achieves 95% accuracy in adversarial prompt detection.

    <div class="abstract">Large artificial intelligence (AI) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in various application scenarios, but deploying them at the network edge poses significant challenges due to issues such as data privacy, computational resources, and latency. In this paper, we explore federated fine-tuning and collaborative reasoning techniques to facilitate the implementation of large AI models in resource-constrained wireless networks. Firstly, promising applications of large AI models within specific domains are discussed. Subsequently, federated fine-tuning methods are proposed to adapt large AI models to specific tasks or environments at the network edge, effectively addressing the challenges associated with communication overhead and enhancing communication efficiency. These methodologies follow clustered, hierarchical, and asynchronous paradigms to effectively tackle privacy issues and eliminate data silos. Furthermore, to enhance operational efficiency and reduce latency, efficient frameworks for model collaborative reasoning are developed, which include decentralized horizontal collaboration, cloud-edge-end vertical collaboration, and multi-access collaboration. Next, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in reducing the fine-tuning loss of large AI models across various downstream tasks. Finally, several open challenges and research opportunities are outlined.</div>

    <div class="abstract">While standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on chunks, GraphRAG structures knowledge as graphs to leverage the relations among entities. However, previous GraphRAG methods are limited by binary relations: one edge in the graph only connects two entities, which cannot well model the n-ary relations among more than two entities that widely exist in reality. To address this limitation, we propose HyperGraphRAG, a novel hypergraph-based RAG method that represents n-ary relational facts via hyperedges, modeling the complicated n-ary relations in the real world. To retrieve and generate over hypergraphs, we introduce a complete pipeline with a hypergraph construction method, a hypergraph retrieval strategy, and a hypergraph-guided generation mechanism. Experiments across medicine, agriculture, computer science, and law demonstrate that HyperGraphRAG outperforms standard RAG and GraphRAG in accuracy and generation quality.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs) treat visual tokens as "a sequence of text", integrating them with text tokens into a large language model (LLM). However, a great quantity of visual tokens significantly increases the demand for computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose InternVL-X, which outperforms the InternVL model in both performance and efficiency by incorporating three visual token compression methods. First, we propose a novel vision-language projector, PVTC. This component integrates adjacent visual embeddings to form a local query and utilizes the transformed CLS token as a global query, then performs point-to-region cross-attention through these local and global queries to more effectively convert visual features. Second, we present a layer-wise visual token compression module, LVTC, which compresses tokens in the LLM shallow layers and then expands them through upsampling and residual connections in the deeper layers. This significantly enhances the model computational efficiency. Futhermore, we propose an efficient high resolution slicing method, RVTC, which dynamically adjusts the number of visual tokens based on image area or length filtering. RVTC greatly enhances training efficiency with only a slight reduction in performance. By utilizing 20% or fewer visual tokens, InternVL-X achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 public MLLM benchmarks, and improves the average metric by 2.34% across 12 tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The success of large language models has garnered widespread attention for model merging techniques, especially training-free methods which combine model capabilities within the parameter space. However, two challenges remain: (1) uniform treatment of all parameters leads to performance degradation; (2) search-based algorithms are often inefficient. In this paper, we present an innovative framework termed Reinforced Model Merging (RMM), which encompasses an environment and agent tailored for merging tasks. These components interact to execute layer-wise merging actions, aiming to search the optimal merging architecture. Notably, RMM operates without any gradient computations on the original models, rendering it feasible for edge devices. Furthermore, by utilizing data subsets during the evaluation process, we addressed the bottleneck in the reward feedback phase, thereby accelerating RMM by up to 100 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various vision and NLP datasets and effectively overcomes the limitations of the existing baseline methods.

    <div class="abstract">Advancements in retrieving accessible information have evolved faster in the last few years compared to the decades since the internet's creation. Search engines, like Google, have been the number one way to find relevant data. They have always relied on the user's abilities to find the best information in its billions of links and sources at everybody's fingertips. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has completely transformed the field of information retrieval. The LLMs excel not only at retrieving relevant knowledge but also at summarizing it effectively, making information more accessible and consumable for users. On top of it, the rise of AI Agents has introduced another aspect to information retrieval i.e. dynamic information retrieval which enables the integration of real-time data such as weather forecasts, and financial data with the knowledge base to curate context-aware knowledge. However, despite these advancements the agents remain susceptible to issues of bias and fairness, challenges deeply rooted within the knowledge base and training of LLMs. This study introduces a novel approach to bias-aware knowledge retrieval by leveraging agentic framework and the innovative use of bias detectors as tools to identify and highlight inherent biases in the retrieved content. By empowering users with transparency and awareness, this approach aims to foster more equitable information systems and promote the development of responsible AI.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach for privacy-preserving machine learning. However, ensuring differential privacy (DP) in FL presents challenges due to the trade-off between model utility and privacy protection. Clipping gradients before aggregation is a common strategy to limit privacy loss, but selecting an optimal clipping norm is non-trivial, as excessively high values compromise privacy, while overly restrictive clipping degrades model performance. In this work, we propose an adaptive clipping mechanism that dynamically adjusts the clipping norm using a multi-objective optimization framework. By integrating privacy and utility considerations into the optimization objective, our approach balances privacy preservation with model accuracy. We theoretically analyze the convergence properties of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our results show that adaptive clipping consistently outperforms fixed-clipping baselines, achieving improved accuracy under the same privacy constraints. This work highlights the potential of dynamic clipping strategies to enhance privacy-utility trade-offs in differentially private federated learning.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities but rely primarily on parametric knowledge, limiting factual accuracy. While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for coding tasks, yet in most scenarios it is assumed that all relevant information can be either accessed in context or matches their training data. We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models afford opportunities for using computers for intensive tasks, realizing research opportunities that have not been considered before. One such opportunity could be a systematic interrogation of the scientific literature. Here, we show how a large language model can be used to construct a literature review of 2699 publications associated with microphysics parametrizations in the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model, with the goal of learning how they were used and their systematic biases, when simulating precipitation. The database was constructed of publications identified from Web of Science and Scopus searches. The large language model GPT-4 Turbo was used to extract information about model configurations and performance from the text of 2699 publications. Our results reveal the landscape of how nine of the most popular microphysics parameterizations have been used around the world: Lin, Ferrier, WRF Single-Moment, Goddard Cumulus Ensemble, Morrison, Thompson, and WRF Double-Moment. More studies used one-moment parameterizations before 2020 and two-moment parameterizations after 2020. Seven out of nine parameterizations tended to overestimate precipitation. However, systematic biases of parameterizations differed in various regions. Except simulations using the Lin, Ferrier, and Goddard parameterizations that tended to underestimate precipitation over almost all locations, the remaining six parameterizations tended to overestimate, particularly over China, southeast Asia, western United States, and central Africa. This method could be used by other researchers to help understand how the increasingly massive body of scientific literature can be harnessed through the power of artificial intelligence to solve their research problems.</div>

    <h3>Fwd2Bot: LVLM Visual Token Compression with Double Forward Bottleneck</h3>

    <div class="abstract">In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study. Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</div>

    <div class="abstract">In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board," "understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</div>
