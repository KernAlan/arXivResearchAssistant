    <div class="abstract">Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability, such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy (PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA, MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner. The model checkpoints are available at https://huggingface.co/InfiX-ai/InfiAlign-Qwen-7B-SFT.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA, which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.</div>

    <h3>Provable Post-Training Quantization: Theoretical Analysis of OPTQ and   Qronos</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices, including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard, their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores and comprehensive analytical logs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy. Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches, probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from \textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically, LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to existing RAG systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate, truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms, political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems, suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment sensitivity.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment, food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks, MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in the development and assessment of LLMs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance, achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act accordingly swiftly.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However, empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.</div>

    <h3>Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via   Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance. However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy. It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3 family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value for efficient reasoning.</div>

    <h3>Pruning Large Language Models by Identifying and Preserving Functional   Networks</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation. Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

    <h3>Incident Response Planning Using a Lightweight Large Language Model with   Reduced Hallucination</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a) achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes to a broad range of incident types and response actions.</div>

    <h3>Aligning LLMs on a Budget: Inference-Time Alignment with Heuristic   Reward Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets, HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence, often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge. PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.</div>
