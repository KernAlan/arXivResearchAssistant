    <div class="abstract">Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM. Our code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.</div>

    <div class="abstract">It has been demonstrated that carefully designed reasoning paradigms, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), can enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models by detailed thinking and extensive thought searching, unbounded branching factors in the searching space create prohibitive reasoning consumption. However these methods fall into the trap of local optimum reasoning, which means the model lacks a global perspective while solving problems. We propose a novel reasoning paradigm called Reason from Future (RFF), which generates reasoning paths by bidirectional reasoning that combines top-down planning with bottom-up reasoning accumulation. The essence of RFF lies in its reverse reasoning mechanism, which prioritizes core logical relationships and imposes goal-oriented constraints on intermediate steps, thereby reducing the searching space and mitigating error accumulation inherent in sequential forward reasoning. Empirical evaluations across diverse experiments demonstrate that RFF outperforms conventional paradigms with higher accuracy and less searching space to solve complex tasks.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Agentic workflows -- where multiple large language model (LLM) instances interact to solve tasks -- are increasingly built on feedback mechanisms, where one model evaluates and critiques another. Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Tool use in stateful environments presents unique challenges for large language models (LLMs), where existing test-time compute strategies relying on repeated trials in the environment are impractical. We propose dynamics modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without repeatedly querying the oracle environment.</div>

    <h3>Why do AI agents communicate in human language?</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Content creation has dramatically progressed with the rapid advancement of large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. While this progress has greatly enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability across generative models.

    <div class="abstract">Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S. federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation, heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.</div>

    <h3>Efficient Knowledge Editing via Minimal Precomputation</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a "precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.</div>

    <h3>Does Thinking More always Help? Understanding Test-Time Scaling in   Reasoning Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Developing safety-critical automotive software presents significant challenges due to increasing system complexity and strict regulatory demands. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The framework uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate code generation in languages such as C++, incorporating safety-focused practices such as static verification, test-driven development and iterative refinement. A feedback-driven pipeline ensures the integration of test, simulation and verification for compliance with safety standards. The framework is validated through the development of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. Comparative benchmarking of LLMs ensures optimal model selection for accuracy and reliability. Results demonstrate that the framework enables automatic code generation while ensuring compliance with safety-critical requirements, systematically integrating GenAI into automotive software engineering. This work advances the use of AI in safety-critical domains, bridging the gap between state-of-the-art generative models and real-world safety requirements.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful information handling capabilities and are widely integrated into chatbot applications. OpenAI provides a platform for developers to construct custom GPTs, extending ChatGPT's functions and integrating external services. Since its release in November 2023, over 3 million custom GPTs have been created. However, such a vast ecosystem also conceals security and privacy threats. For developers, instruction leaking attacks threaten the intellectual property of instructions in custom GPTs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. For users, unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs or integrated third-party services raises significant privacy concerns. To systematically evaluate the scope of threats in real-world LLM applications, we develop three phases instruction leaking attacks target GPTs with different defense level. Our widespread experiments on 10,000 real-world custom GPTs reveal that over 98.8% of GPTs are vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks via one or more adversarial prompts, and half of the remaining GPTs can also be attacked through multiround conversations. We also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of defensive strategies and identify unwanted behaviors in custom GPTs. Our findings show that 77.5% of custom GPTs with defense strategies are vulnerable to basic instruction leaking attacks. Additionally, we reveal that 738 custom GPTs collect user conversational information, and identified 8 GPTs exhibiting data access behaviors that are unnecessary for their intended functionalities. Our findings raise awareness among GPT developers about the importance of integrating specific defensive strategies in their instructions and highlight users' concerns about data privacy when using LLM-based applications.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability.

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">AI for Industrial Asset Lifecycle Management aims to automate complex operational workflows -- such as condition monitoring, maintenance planning, and intervention scheduling -- to reduce human workload and minimize system downtime. Traditional AI/ML approaches have primarily tackled these problems in isolation, solving narrow tasks within the broader operational pipeline. In contrast, the emergence of AI agents and large language models (LLMs) introduces a next-generation opportunity: enabling end-to-end automation across the entire asset lifecycle. This paper envisions a future where AI agents autonomously manage tasks that previously required distinct expertise and manual coordination. To this end, we introduce AssetOpsBench -- a unified framework and environment designed to guide the development, orchestration, and evaluation of domain-specific agents tailored for Industry 4.0 applications. We outline the key requirements for such holistic systems and provide actionable insights into building agents that integrate perception, reasoning, and control for real-world industrial operations. The software is available at https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely mostly on individual assessments or a single round of pairwise assessments, preventing the judge LLM from developing a global ranking perspective. To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with human scoring.</div>

    <h3>AhaKV: Adaptive Holistic Attention-Driven KV Cache Eviction for   Efficient Inference of Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the (Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores. To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism, AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.</div>

    <h3>Verbalized Confidence Triggers Self-Verification: Emergent Behavior   Without Explicit Reasoning Supervision</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Uncertainty calibration is essential for the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly when users rely on verbalized confidence estimates. While prior work has focused on classifiers or short-form generation, confidence calibration for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning remains largely unexplored. Surprisingly, we find that supervised fine-tuning with scalar confidence labels alone suffices to elicit self-verification behavior of language models, without any explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement learning-based rewards. Despite being trained only to produce a verbalized confidence score without any self-verifying examples, the model learns to generate longer and self-checking responses for low-confidence queries while providing more concise answers for high-confidence ones. We further propose a simple rethinking method that boosts performance via test-time scaling based on calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on GSM8K and held-out reasoning tasks such as MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge show that our confidence-aware fine-tuning improves both calibration and accuracy, while also enhancing interpretability by aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence.</div>
