        <h3>ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights</h3>
        Hey boss, found 3 cool papers today that I think you'll love:

<ol>
<li>Stanford researchers introduced **HSplitLoRA**, a game-changing fine-tuning framework for large language models that makes it easier to customize them on devices with different computing power. It smartly identifies which parts of the model to focus on, making fine-tuning cheaper and faster while ensuring high accuracy. This could really democratize access to personalized AI without the heavy costs!</li>

<li>A team from Google AI developed **AutoLibra**, an innovative tool to evaluate and improve agent behaviors using open-ended human feedback. Instead of relying on basic success metrics, it creates detailed evaluation metrics from real user comments, leading to better agent training. Early results show it can boost agent performance significantlyâ€”up to 20% improvement in text games!</li>

<li>Finally, researchers tackled the challenges of multi-round retrieval in RAG with a new method called **SIM-RAG**. It helps systems know when they've gathered enough information before moving on, reducing errors and unnecessary searches. This approach is efficient and doesnâ€™t require any major changes to existing setups, which is a big win for refining AI responses!</li>
</ol>

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any of these!

    <h3>HSplitLoRA: A Heterogeneous Split Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning   Framework for Large Language Models</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices. Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.</div>

    <h3>AutoLibra: Agent Metric Induction from Open-Ended Feedback</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.</div>

    <h3>Knowing You Don't Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round   RAG through Self-Practicing</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.   This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning.   Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</div>
