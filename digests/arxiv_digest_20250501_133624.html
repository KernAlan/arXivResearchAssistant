    <div class="abstract">We present an embodied robotic system with an LLM-driven agent-orchestration architecture for autonomous household object management. The system integrates memory-augmented task planning, enabling robots to execute high-level user commands while tracking past actions. It employs three specialized agents: a routing agent, a task planning agent, and a knowledge base agent, each powered by task-specific LLMs. By leveraging in-context learning, our system avoids the need for explicit model training. RAG enables the system to retrieve context from past interactions, enhancing long-term object tracking. A combination of Grounded SAM and LLaMa3.2-Vision provides robust object detection, facilitating semantic scene understanding for task planning. Evaluation across three household scenarios demonstrates high task planning accuracy and an improvement in memory recall due to RAG. Specifically, Qwen2.5 yields best performance for specialized agents, while LLaMA3.1 excels in routing tasks. The source code is available at: https://github.com/marc1198/chat-hsr.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) currently struggle to sequentially add new memories and integrate new knowledge. These limitations contrast with the human ability to continuously learn from new experiences and acquire knowledge throughout life. Most existing approaches add memories either through large context windows or external memory buffers (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and studies on knowledge injection rarely test scenarios resembling everyday life events. In this work, we introduce a continual learning framework, Memory Embedded in Gated LLMs (MEGa), which injects event memories directly into the weights of LLMs. Each memory is stored in a dedicated set of gated low-rank weights. During inference, a gating mechanism activates relevant memory weights by matching query embeddings to stored memory embeddings. This enables the model to both recall entire memories and answer related questions. On two datasets - fictional characters and Wikipedia events - MEGa outperforms baseline approaches in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our model draws inspiration from the complementary memory system of the human brain.</div>

    <h3>A Cost-Effective LLM-based Approach to Identify Wildlife Trafficking in   Online Marketplaces</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Wildlife trafficking remains a critical global issue, significantly impacting biodiversity, ecological stability, and public health. Despite efforts to combat this illicit trade, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier to sell wildlife products, putting new pressure on wild populations of endangered and threatened species. The use of these platforms also opens a new opportunity: as criminals sell wildlife products online, they leave digital traces of their activity that can provide insights into trafficking activities as well as how they can be disrupted. The challenge lies in finding these traces. Online marketplaces publish ads for a plethora of products, and identifying ads for wildlife-related products is like finding a needle in a haystack. Learning classifiers can automate ad identification, but creating them requires costly, time-consuming data labeling that hinders support for diverse ads and research questions. This paper addresses a critical challenge in the data science pipeline for wildlife trafficking analytics: generating quality labeled data for classifiers that select relevant data. While large language models (LLMs) can directly label advertisements, doing so at scale is prohibitively expensive. We propose a cost-effective strategy that leverages LLMs to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of the data and uses these labels to create specialized classification models. Our novel method automatically gathers diverse and representative samples to be labeled while minimizing the labeling costs. Our experimental evaluation shows that our classifiers achieve up to 95% F1 score, outperforming LLMs at a lower cost. We present real use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling analyses of different aspects of wildlife trafficking.</div>

    <h3>Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents</h3>

    <div class="abstract">A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.</div>

    <h3>Ascendra: Dynamic Request Prioritization for Efficient LLM Serving</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for more efficient serving strategies. In this context, efficiency refers to the proportion of requests that meet their Service Level Objectives (SLOs), particularly for Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT). However, existing systems often prioritize one metric at the cost of the other. We present Ascendra, an LLM serving system designed to meet both TTFT and TBT SLOs simultaneously. The core insight behind Ascendra is that a request's urgency evolves as it approaches its deadline. To leverage this, Ascendra partitions GPU resources into two types of instances: low-priority and high-priority. Low-priority instances maximize throughput by processing requests out of arrival order, but at the risk of request starvation. To address this, Ascendra employs a performance model to predict requests at risk of missing their SLOs and proactively offloads them to high-priority instances. High-priority instances are optimized for low-latency execution and handle urgent requests nearing their deadlines. This partitioned architecture enables Ascendra to effectively balance high throughput and low latency. Extensive evaluation shows that Ascendra improves system throughput by up to 1.7x compared to vLLM and Sarathi-Serve while meeting both TTFT and TBT SLOs.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Scripting interfaces enable users to automate tasks and customize software workflows, but creating scripts traditionally requires programming expertise and familiarity with specific APIs, posing barriers for many users. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language queries, runtime code generation is severely limited due to unverified code, security risks, longer response times, and higher computational costs. To bridge the gap, we propose an offline simulation framework to curate a software-specific skillset, a collection of verified scripts, by exploiting LLMs and publicly available scripting guides. Our framework comprises two components: (1) task creation, using top-down functionality guidance and bottom-up API synergy exploration to generate helpful tasks; and (2) skill generation with trials, refining and validating scripts based on execution feedback. To efficiently navigate the extensive API landscape, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based link prediction model to capture API synergy, enabling the generation of skills involving underutilized APIs and expanding the skillset's diversity. Experiments with Adobe Illustrator demonstrate that our framework significantly improves automation success rates, reduces response time, and saves runtime token costs compared to traditional runtime code generation. This is the first attempt to use software scripting interfaces as a testbed for LLM-based systems, highlighting the advantages of leveraging execution feedback in a controlled environment and offering valuable insights into aligning AI capabilities with user needs in specialized software domains.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Despite recent progress in Language Models (LMs) for software engineering, collecting training data remains a significant pain point. Existing datasets are small, with at most 1,000s of training instances from 11 or fewer GitHub repositories. The procedures to curate such datasets are often complex, necessitating hundreds of hours of human labor; companion execution environments also take up several terabytes of storage, severely limiting their scalability and usability. To address this pain point, we introduce SWE-smith, a novel pipeline for generating software engineering training data at scale. Given any Python codebase, SWE-smith constructs a corresponding execution environment, then automatically synthesizes 100s to 1,000s of task instances that break existing test(s) in the codebase. Using SWE-smith, we create a dataset of 50k instances sourced from 128 GitHub repositories, an order of magnitude larger than all previous works. We train SWE-agent-LM-32B, achieving 40.2% Pass@1 resolve rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, state of the art among open source models. We open source SWE-smith (collection procedure, task instances, trajectories, models) to lower the barrier of entry for research in LM systems for automated software engineering.

    <div class="abstract">Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate impressive long-horizon reasoning capabilities. However, their reliance on static internal knowledge limits their performance on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive research reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address this, we propose \textbf{WebThinker}, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs to autonomously search the web, navigate web pages, and draft research reports during the reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a \textbf{Deep Web Explorer} module, enabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract information from the web when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an \textbf{Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy}, allowing the model to seamlessly interleave reasoning, information gathering, and report writing in real time. To further enhance research tool utilization, we introduce an \textbf{RL-based training strategy} via iterative online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and scientific report generation tasks (Glaive) demonstrate that WebThinker significantly outperforms existing methods and strong proprietary systems. Our approach enhances LRM reliability and applicability in complex scenarios, paving the way for more capable and versatile deep research systems.

    <div class="abstract">With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the issue of generating non-existing facts, known as hallucination, has garnered increasing attention. Previous research in enhancing LLM confidence estimation mainly focuses on the single problem setting. However, LLM awareness of its internal parameterized knowledge boundary under the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires answering multiple problems accurately simultaneously, remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel method, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25% in average precision.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="abstract">Recently, long-thought reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but often incur substantial inference overhead, making efficiency a critical concern. Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit of using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate reasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This motivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the input. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning paths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT paradigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive and efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by merging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles. Second, we apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable reasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within each style group (instance-level). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline approaches, while maintaining performance. Notably, on five mathematical datasets, the average length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%, highlighting the potential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning efficiency in large language models.

    <div class="abstract">With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing demand for intelligent robots capable of assisting humans in daily tasks and performing complex operations. Such robots not only require task planning capabilities but must also execute tasks with stability and robustness. In this paper, we present a closed-loop task planning and acting system, LLM-PAS, which is assisted by a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). While LLM-PAS plans long-horizon tasks in a manner similar to traditional task and motion planners, it also emphasizes the execution phase of the task. By transferring part of the constraint-checking process from the planning phase to the execution phase, LLM-PAS enables exploration of the constraint space and delivers more accurate feedback on environmental anomalies during execution. The reasoning capabilities of the LLM allow it to handle anomalies that cannot be addressed by the robust executor. To further enhance the system's ability to assist the planner during replanning, we propose the First Look Prompting (FLP) method, which induces LLM to generate effective PDDL goals. Through comparative prompting experiments and systematic experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of LLM-PAS in handling anomalous conditions during task execution.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deployed in production frequently face challenges in maintaining their performance in non-stationary environments. This issue is particularly noticeable in medical settings, where temporal dataset shifts often occur. These shifts arise when the distributions of training data differ from those of the data encountered during deployment over time. Further, new labeled data to continuously retrain AI is not typically available in a timely manner due to data access limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive self-adaptive AI approach, or pro-adaptive, where we model the temporal trajectory of AI parameters, allowing us to short-term forecast parameter values. To this end, we use polynomial spline bases, within an extensible Functional Data Analysis framework. We validate our methodology with a logistic regression model addressing prior probability shift, covariate shift, and concept shift. This validation is conducted on both a controlled simulated dataset and a publicly available real-world COVID-19 dataset from Mexico, with various shifts occurring between 2020 and 2024. Our results indicate that this approach enhances the performance of AI against shifts compared to baseline stable models trained at different time distances from the present, without requiring updated training data. This work lays the foundation for pro-adaptive AI research against dynamic, non-stationary environments, being compatible with data protection, in resilient AI production environments for health.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, typically using CLIP-ViT as their visual encoder due to its strong text-image alignment capabilities. While prior studies suggest that different CLIP-ViT layers capture different types of information, with shallower layers focusing on fine visual details and deeper layers aligning more closely with textual semantics, most MLLMs still select visual features based on empirical heuristics rather than systematic analysis. In this work, we propose a Layer-wise Representation Similarity approach to group CLIP-ViT layers with similar behaviors into {shallow, middle, and deep} categories and assess their impact on MLLM performance. Building on this foundation, we revisit the visual layer selection problem in MLLMs at scale, training LLaVA-style models ranging from 1.4B to 7B parameters. Through extensive experiments across 10 datasets and 4 tasks, we find that: (1) deep layers are essential for OCR tasks; (2) shallow and middle layers substantially outperform deep layers on reasoning tasks involving counting, positioning, and object localization; (3) a lightweight fusion of features across shallow, middle, and deep layers consistently outperforms specialized fusion baselines and single-layer selections, achieving gains on 9 out of 10 datasets. Our work offers the first principled study of visual layer selection in MLLMs, laying the groundwork for deeper investigations into visual representation learning for MLLMs.</div>

Although current AI agents are effective in specialized tasks such as robotics, role-playing, and tool-using, they remain confined to narrow domains. We propose that future AI agents should synthesize the strengths of these specialized systems into a unified framework capable of operating across text, vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, emotional intelligence, and beyond. This integration is not only feasible but also essential for achieving the versatility and adaptability that characterize human intelligence. The convergence of technologies across AI domains, coupled with increasing user demand for cross-domain capabilities, suggests that such integration is within reach. Ultimately, the development of these versatile agents is a critical step toward realizing AGI. This paper explores the rationale for this shift, potential pathways for achieving it.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) is a challenging task that lies at the intersection of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), requiring the identification of structured event information from spoken language. In this work, we present a modular, pipeline-based SpeechEE framework that integrates high-performance ASR with semantic search-enhanced prompting of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system first classifies speech segments likely to contain events using a hybrid filtering mechanism including rule-based, BERT-based, and LLM-based models. It then employs few-shot LLM prompting, dynamically enriched via semantic similarity retrieval, to identify event triggers and extract corresponding arguments. We evaluate the pipeline using multiple LLMs (Llama3-8B, GPT-4o-mini, and o1-mini) highlighting significant performance gains with o1-mini, which achieves 63.3% F1 on trigger classification and 27.8% F1 on argument classification, outperforming prior benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that pipeline approaches, when empowered by retrieval-augmented LLMs, can rival or exceed end-to-end systems while maintaining interpretability and modularity. This work provides practical insights into LLM-driven event extraction and opens pathways for future hybrid models combining textual and acoustic features.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aim to integrate multimodal understanding and generation abilities through a single framework. Despite their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published at https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen.git to facilitate further advancements across the field.</div>

    <div class="abstract">The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has rapidly emerged as a transformative research direction. While MLLMs significantly extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning across multimodal inputs remains a major challenge. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms--value-free and value-based methods--and analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning multimodal information. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and existing limitations, and propose future research directions to address current bottlenecks such as sparse rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive and structured guide to researchers interested in advancing RL-based reasoning in the multimodal era.</div>

    <div class="abstract">As LLM-generated code grows in popularity, more evaluation is needed to assess the risks of using such tools, especially for safety-critical applications such as path planning. Existing coding benchmarks are insufficient as they do not reflect the context and complexity of safety-critical applications. To this end, we assessed six LLMs' abilities to generate the code for three different path-planning algorithms and tested them on three maps of various difficulties. Our results suggest that LLM-generated code presents serious hazards for path planning applications and should not be applied in safety-critical contexts without rigorous testing.</div>

    <h3>CachePrune: Neural-Based Attribution Defense Against Indirect Prompt   Injection Attacks</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) are identified as being susceptible to indirect prompt injection attack, where the model undesirably deviates from user-provided instructions by executing tasks injected in the prompt context. This vulnerability stems from LLMs' inability to distinguish between data and instructions within a prompt. In this paper, we propose CachePrune that defends against this attack by identifying and pruning task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the LLM to treat the text spans of input prompt context as only pure data, instead of any indicator of instruction following. These neurons are identified via feature attribution with a loss function induced from an upperbound of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective. We show that such a loss function enables effective feature attribution with only a few samples. We further improve on the quality of feature attribution, by exploiting an observed triggering effect in instruction following. Our approach does not impose any formatting on the original prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM calls. Experiments show that CachePrune significantly reduces attack success rates without compromising the response quality. Note: This paper aims to defend against indirect prompt injection attacks, with the goal of developing more secure and robust AI systems.</div>
