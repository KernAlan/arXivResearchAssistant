    <div class="abstract">Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data, thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) = 0.99.</div>

    <div class="abstract">With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency. Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency, while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2 \sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution. Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT, which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting. GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks. In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.</div>

    <div class="abstract">AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense -- there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task? How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training dataset size?   In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason. In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.   Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight. Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes, lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration), which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance (MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live deployment.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S. equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are important for arbitrage trading.</div>

    <h3>Analyzing and Internalizing Complex Policy Documents for LLM Agents</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%.

    <h3>Iterative Amortized Inference: Unifying In-Context Learning and Learned   Optimizers</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches, including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled. Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision. In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1, outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process to all future models.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning. Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.</div>

    <div class="abstract">When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system, they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests, and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time, we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users' sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional controls.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency. Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization, allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.</div>

To the best of our knowledge, test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers, like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025 tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for this gap.</div>

Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems.

    <h3>HiLoRA: Adaptive Hierarchical LoRA Routing for Training-Free Domain   Generalization</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.   However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy or insufficiency that degrade performance.   In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence, \texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative ROCs.   We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the most relevant LoRAs with high probability.   Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small $55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference throughput.</div>

    <div class="abstract">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity. At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators, optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptFlow.</div>

    <h3>HALF: Harm-Aware LLM Fairness Evaluation Aligned with Deployment</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical. However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.</div>

    <h3>Precise Attribute Intensity Control in Large Language Models via   Targeted Representation Editing</h3>

    <div class="abstract">Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods, however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks: preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

    <div class="abstract">Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning, drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs reasoning with task demands.
